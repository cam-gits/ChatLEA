The Government is the group of senior ministers responsible for the executive power of the State. This means that the Government is responsible for giving effect to laws. You can view this list of current Government Ministers.Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the assistance of the civil service, police force and military. The head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is nominated by the D·il. The Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the T·naiste) and a cabinet of ministers to take responsibility for the departments of government.The Government decides major questions of policy and carries out a number of different and important functions.
 
How the Government is formed

After a general election, the D·il (the Irish parliament) elects the Taoiseach. Normally the Taoiseach is the leader of the largest party in the Dail. If no one party has a majority of TDs (members of the D·il), a number of parties may come together to form a coalition government.The Taoiseach then nominates a deputy (the T·naiste) and a cabinet of ministers who take charge of the departments of government.The acting Taoiseach (the Taoiseach of the former Government) may have to ask the President to dissolve the D·il and call another general election if no Government can be formed.The composition of the GovernmentArticle 28 of Bunreacht na h…ireann (the Irish Constitution) sets out the composition of Government. The Constitution states that the Government must not be smaller than 7 members or larger than 15 members.The members of the Government must be members of either D·il …ireann or Seanad …ireann. There cannot be more than 2 members of Seanad …ireann appointed to the Government. The Taoiseach, the T·naiste and the Minister for Finance must be members of D·il …ireann.The Taoiseach may also appoint Ministers of State who are also known as Junior Ministers. They are not actually members of the Cabinet but they help Government ministers in their parliamentary and departmental work.The Taoiseach also appoints an Attorney General to advise the Government on legal issues. The Attorney General is not a member of the Government but they traditionally attend Cabinet meetings.Coalition governmentsIf, after a general election, no party can get the support of the majority of the members of the D·il, 2 or more parties may agree to work together as a coalition government.The coalition parties agree on who will be nominated as Taoiseach. Usually, it is the leader of the larger party. In recent years, the leader of the smaller party has been usually nominated as T·naiste.The ministerial portfolios are then shared between the parties. Usually the larger party is given a greater number of portfolios. The leader of each party decides which elected members of the party to give those portfolios to.The coalition government remains in power for as long as it keeps the support of the majority of the D·il. If the coalition parties find that they cannot agree and can no longer work together, the Taoiseach may advise the President to dissolve the D·il.
 
The Taoiseach

The Taoiseach is the head of the Government. Taoiseach means ëleaderí or ëchiefí in Irish, but the Irish word is always used for referring to the head of Government in Ireland.The Taoiseach acts as a channel of communication between the Government and the President. They advise the President about summoning and dissolving the D·il. They present Bills (or proposals for legislation) to the President for signature so that they can become Acts with legal effect. The Taoiseach also keeps the President generally informed on domestic and international policy matters.As the leading public figure in the Government, the Taoiseach also acts as a spokesperson for the Government on major policy issues and chairs Cabinet meetings.They take an interest in the affairs of all the Departments of State and make sure that the plans of departments are co-ordinated. They make sure that Cabinet decisions are carried out by the ministers and that the ministers fully understand the implications of different Government policies.The Taoiseach also has a major role to play in our relations with foreign countries. They represent Ireland abroad and regularly meets with the other heads of state of the European Union to help shape European policy. The Taoiseach is Irelandís representative on the European Council.The Taoiseach and all the ministers are answerable to D·il Eireann. The Taoiseach is assisted in his or her duties by the Government Chief Whip.
 
The T·naiste

The T·naiste is the deputy Taoiseach.They act in place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach is abroad or ill. If the Taoiseach dies or becomes permanently incapacitated, the Tanaiste would stand in until a new Taoiseach was appointed.The T·naiste may also hold a ministerial portfolio, which means that they may also be a minister of a Department of State.Like the other members of the Government, the T·naiste may be dismissed by the Taoiseach if they consider that there is sufficient reason to do so.
 
The Government Chief Whip

The Government Chief Whip is the Minister of State for the Department of the Taoiseach. They are responsible for the organisation and co-ordination of Government business in D·il …ireann.The Chief Whip acts as a channel of communication between the Government and the opposition parties.The Chief Whip is also responsible for making sure that the Government has a voting majority in the D·il by making sure that TDs attend D·il sessions when a vote is being taken. To instruct a TD to attend to vote, he or she can issue a whip.If a Government TD votes against the Government, they may lose the whip. This means that they are suspended from the party. The Taoiseach can decide to restore a TDís whip.The Chief Whip has a function in monitoring the progress made by Government departments in preparing legislation. They also arrange for the proposed legislation to be considered and debated in the D·il.
 
Ministers and Government departments

Each minister of the Government is responsible for running and managing the department they have been allocated. There are 18 government departments. As well as the Cabinet minister assigned to the department, The Taoiseach may also appoint junior ministers, or Ministers of State to help run departments.Each department employs a large number of civil servants, including a Secretary General, who remain in their positions regardless of changes in the Government. These officials advise and assist the minister in the running of the department.You can find out about government spending in each of these departments on whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie. You can also read about the responsibilities of the people who manage government departments on whodoeswhat.gov.ie.
 
What do government ministers do?

The minister is responsible for their department and the Taoiseach can remove a minister at any time. Ministers are part of the Government and sit at cabinet meetings, where decisions about government policy and proposals for new Government bills are decided.The minister may suggest and propose new or amended legislation to the Government relating to matters that arise in their department.Ministers also have a power to make Statutory Instruments which are also known as delegated or secondary legislation. A Minister may only make a Statutory Instrument if they are permitted to do so in primary legislation. For example, the Immigration Act 2004 gives the Minister for Justice the power to make an order adding or removing a country from the list of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter Ireland.You can view all Irish Government legislation from 1922 onwards.

Civil Service
    

The civil service carries out the work of Government and delivers public services. Civil servants are the permanent staff of departments of state, but they may also work for other public bodies.The Constitution of Ireland does not mention the civil service but it is vital to the functioning of the state.The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour says that the mission of the civil service is the achievement of an excellent service for the Government and the other institutions of State, as well as for the public as citizens and users of public services.Recruitment to the civil and public serviceThe Public Appointments Service provides recruitment, assessment and selection services for the civil service. They also provide recruitment and consultancy services to local authorities, the Health Service Executive , An Garda SÌoch·na and other public bodies.The Commission for Public Service Appointments is a separate body. The Commission sets standards, which it publishes as codes of practice, for recruitment and selection to the civil service, An Garda SÌoch·na and a number of public service bodies, including the Health Service Executive.
 
What does the civil service do?

The civil service has three main functions: It advises the Government on the implementation of policy and is responsible for implementing agreed policy, It helps prepare and draft new legislation and It helps the Government to run the country according to the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.Each Department of State has a permanent staff consisting of administrative, professional, specialist and technical employees. The head civil servant of each Department is the Secretary General, who is recommended by the Minister for that Department and appointed for a period of 7 years by the Government.Below the Secretary General, there are a number of Assistant Secretaries, who are each responsible for specific areas of work in the Department. Below the Assistant Secretaries, there are many officials at varying levels of seniority who are graded according to their seniority.
 
Working for the civil service

The Public Appointments Service provides recruitment, assessment and selection services for the civil service. They also provide recruitment and consultancy services to local authorities, the Health Service Executive , An Garda SÌoch·na and other public bodies. Civil and public service jobs are advertised on publicjobs.ie.The Commission for Public Service Appointments sets standards, which it publishes as codes of practice, for recruitment and selection to the civil service, An Garda SÌoch·na and a number of public service bodies, including the Health Service Executive.
 
Civil servants and public servants

Civil servants are the branch of the public service that works directly for the Government in government departments or in certain state agencies which carry out functions on behalf of the State, but which are independent of Government. For example, those who fall work in the Central Bank of Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners are civil servants of the State.All civil servants are also public servants. However, the public service covers a much broader range of professions which are paid for by the State. This includes many teachers, doctors, nurses, gardaÌ and employees of other agencies that provide state services to the public.
 
Fundamental rights under the Irish Constitution

The Irish Constitution recognises and declares that people living in Ireland have certain fundamental personal rights.Articles 40 to 44 set out these fundamental rights. Many of the rights apply to everyone living in Ireland, including non-Irish citizens.The rights that are set out in these articles have been interpreted by the courts, and some articles have been amended since the Constitution was written in 1937. The courts have found that some rights are protected by the Constitution, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.Fundamental rights are not absolute - they can be limited or restricted by the Oireachtas for certain reasons (for the common good or to keep public order for example).If there is a conflict between two or more constitutional rights in a case, the courts will look at all the circumstances and weigh all of the factors to decide how that particular conflict is to be dealt with. For instance, there is often a clash between one personís right to freedom of expression and another personís right to their good name.
 
Personal rights

Article 40 sets out ëpersonal rightsí, including:Equality before the lawAll citizens shall be held equal before the law (Article 40.1 of the Constitution). This means that the State cannot unjustly, unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminate between citizens. You cannot be treated as inferior or superior to any other person in society simply because of your human attributes or your ethnic, racial, social or religious background.However, when the State is making laws, it may consider differences of capacity and of social function between individuals in society.Right to lifeThe Constitution specifically recognises and protects your right to life (Article 40.4).Your right to life also means the right to have nature take its course and to die a natural death. That does not mean that you have the right to have your life terminated or death unnaturally accelerated.In May 2018, the people voted in a referendum to allow the Oireachtas to pass laws regulating the termination of pregnancy. The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law on 20 December 2018.Personal libertyThe Constitution guarantees that you have a right to liberty and freedom, except in accordance with the law (Article 40.4).This means that, in general, you are entitled to your own personal freedom except where regulated by law. In addition, the law may provide for your detention in certain circumstances and the State may only breach your right to personal liberty in circumstances that come within that law.If you believe that you are being detained or held unlawfully, you can make an application to the High Court. If the person or institution detaining you cannot justify your detention or prove that it is lawful, the High Court may order that you be released. This is called a habeas corpus order.You have a right to move freely within the State. You also have a broader right to travel and to get a passport for the purpose of travelling.Your right to a passport may be restricted or limited. For example, before granting you bail, a court may require you to hand over your passport. The State may also restrict your right to travel abroad for the purposes of national security.Freedom of expressionYou have a right to freely express your convictions and opinions (Article 40.6.1.i). However, that right can be limited in the interests of public order and morality. You can also not use this right to defame someone else as this would interfere their constitutional right to a good name.The Constitution also states that it is an offence to publish or utter seditious (material undermining the authority of the State or advocating for the overthrow of the State) or indecent material.Following a referendum in May 2018, the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Act 2018 was passed. Blasphemy is no longer a constitutional offence.The State is also obliged by the Constitution to make sure that media such as the radio, the press and the cinema are not used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. For example, the Censorship of Publications Acts and the Censorship of Films Acts allow censorship of publications like books, films and DVDs.Freedom of assemblyYou have a right to assemble or meet peacefully and without weapons (Article 40.6.1.ii). This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. The law prevents or controls meetings that are calculated or designed to cause a riot or breach of the peace or which may be a danger to the general public.There are other limitations on your freedom of assembly. You cannot meet on private property without the consent of the owner - that is trespass. Parades and processions are not illegal but it is a public nuisance to obstruct a highway without authorisation.You may not hold a procession or meeting within half a mile of the Houses of the Oireachtas when a chief superintendent or higher ranking garda informs the organisers of such an event that it is prohibited or where any garda within that half-mile radius asks you to disperse.Freedom of associationThe Constitution guarantees your right to form associations and unions (Article 40.6.1.iii). You may form any type of association for whatever purpose you choose, whether it is sporting, social, charitable, commercial or political.This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. For example, associations formed for the purpose of treason or some anti-constitutional or illegal purpose cannot rely on this right to freedom of association.Similarly, you canít force someone to join any particular association or union or always force a union or association to accept you.The right to fair proceduresThe courts and all public bodies or persons making decisions that affect your constitutional rights must treat you fairly. Two of the essential components of fair procedures in this context are:The person making the decision that affects you should not be biased or appear to be biased.You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to comment on the material put forward by the other side.Bodily integrityYou have a right not to have your body or person unjustifiably interfered with. A person can only interfere with your body with a valid justification and in a proportionate manner. Similarly, you have a right not to be subjected to torture, inhumane or degrading treatment.If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison.Trial by juryYour constitutional right to trial by jury only exists in certain criminal cases.If you have been charged with a "non-minor" offence, you will be tried by a judge sitting with a jury. There are some offences for which you will be given a choice - whether you want to have your case decided by a District Court judge sitting alone or by a judge sitting with a jury.The jury must consist of those who have been chosen at random from a diverse range of jurors from the community.The right to privacyThe Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy but the courts recognise that the personal rights in the Constitution imply the right to privacy. It has sometimes been described as the right ìto be let aloneî in private settings.For example, your private written communications and telephone conversations cannot be deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably interfered with. Your rights to cast a secret ballot in elections and to the confidentiality of medical details are other examples of the right to privacy in action.However, your right to privacy may be limited or restricted by legislation in the interests of the common good, public order and morality.The right to earn a livelihoodAs a citizen, you have a right to work and to earn a living, whether you are male or female. However, that general right doesnít mean that you can insist on being employed in a particular role or area or by a particular employer.The State has a general duty to protect your right to work and earn a livelihood from unjust attack.Inviolability of a citizen's dwellingThe Constitution declares that the dwelling of a citizen is inviolable and shall not be entered forcibly except in accordance with the law (Article 40.5). This means that no one, including the GardaÌ, may enter the place where you live without a warrant or other legal authority to enter.If you are arrested as a result of an unlawful entry into your home, your arrest is illegal. Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful entry onto your dwelling may be inadmissible in court.
 
The rights of the family

The family founded on marriage possesses a collection of constitutional rights (Article 41 and 42). These include:The right to marital privacy.The right of coupes to make their own decisions about family planning.The right to consort together, to enjoy each other's company and to procreate. This right may be limited or restricted where a family member is in prison or where one spouse is not an Irish citizen. The right of parents to be the main and natural educators of their children. The State must respect your right as parents to provide for the religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social education of your children. The State cannot oblige you to send your children to school or to any particular type of school but it may require that children receive a certain minimum education.The right to free primary education - this means that the State must contribute towards for your children's primary education. State aid for schools must not discriminate between schools of different religions.The right to decide the religion of your children. The State cannot interfere with this right.Many of these rights equally apply to non-marital families.There is a constitutional principle that married parents have equal rights to and are joint guardians of their children. If the parents separate or divorce, the courts may decide who will have custody of the children. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the children.The rights of childrenArticle 42A was added to the Constitution in 2015. It affirms childrenís natural and imprescriptible rights and the Stateís duty to uphold these rights. Children have the right for their best interests to be of paramount consideration where the State seeks to intervene to protect their safety and welfare.This right applies in all court proceedings concerning adoption, guardianship, custody, and access. In these proceedings, children also have the right to have their views ascertained and considered by the courts. The courts are to have regard to a childís age and maturity when considering their views in accordance with this right.Upcoming referendums on family and careTwo constitutional referendums will be held on 8 March 2024 to amend the Constitution.You can find information about the proposed changes to the Constitution.The General Scheme of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2023 has been published, which is draft legislation for these proposed amendments.
 
Property rights

The Constitution declares that the State will vindicate the property rights of every citizen. This means that you have a right to own, transfer and inherit property. You also have the right to bequeath property upon your death. The State guarantees to pass no law to abolish these rights.Article 43 acknowledges that these rights ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice. This means that the State may pass laws limiting your right to private property in the interests of the common good. The most common form of limitation is taxation on ownership, transfer and inheritance.Other examples of restrictions or limitations on your right to own property include town and regional planning, protection of national monuments, compulsory acquisition of land.If the State passes a law that otherwise restricts your property rights, it may be required to compensate you for this restriction.
 
Religious freedom

Article 44 of the Constitution deals with religion.You are free to practise your religion and your freedom of conscience. The State guarantees not to endow or favour any religion and not to discriminate on the grounds of religion.State aid for schools cannot discriminate between schools of different religious denominations. Every child has the right to attend a denominational school receiving State funding without having to participate in religious instruction in the school.Your right to religious liberty may be limited to protect public order and morality.


The Irish Constitution


The Irish Constitution (or Bunreacht na h…ireann) was ratified by the Irish people in 1937. It is the fundamental law of the State.Every part of the Constitution is set out in both the Irish and English languages. Article 8 states that the Irish language is the first official language and that the English language is recognised as a second official language.The Constitution establishes the branches or organs of government, it establishes the courts and sets out how those institutions should be run. It also describes the fundamental rights of every Irish citizen.The Constitution is also part of a wider human rights framework in Ireland. This refers to all legal and other human rights commitments made by Ireland, including treaties under the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
 
Structure of the Constitution

The Constitution contains 50 articles.Articles 1-39 define the functions of the State and its agencies and set out the separation of powers in the State.Articles 40-44 provide for the fundamental rights of Irish citizens.The remaining articles are:Article 45, which sets out directive principles of social policyArticle 46, which sets out how the Constitution may be amendedArticle 47, which governs referendumsArticles 48-50, which repealed the previous Constitution (of Saorst·t …ireann) and ensured the continuance of laws
 
The Constitution and legislation

One of the most important Articles of the Constitution is Article 15.4, which states that the Oireachtas must not enact any law that is repugnant to the Constitution (conflicts with the Constitution). This means that the Constitution is superior to all other law.If any element of an existing law is found to be repugnant to the Constitution, that element of the law is invalid (Article 15.4.2).If a proposed new law would be repugnant to the Constitution, it cannot be enacted unless the Constitution has been amended accordingly ñ see 'Amending the Constitution' below.Article 25 provides that Bills passed by both houses of the Oireachtas should be presented to the President for signature. Once a Bill has been signed by the President, it becomes law. However, Article 26 provides that the President may refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to decide if it is repugnant to the Constitution. The President will not sign the Bill into law if the Supreme Court decides against it.Every law that is enacted is presumed to be constitutional until it is proven not to be. The High Court has the power or jurisdiction to cancel any law or part of any law that is repugnant to the Constitution.
 
Amending the Constitution

The consent of the Irish people is needed before the Constitution can be amended. This means that amendments to the Constitution can only be made by way of a constitutional referendum. Up to 2023, 38 constitutional referendums had been held, of which 32 resulted in amendments to the Constitution.

Main institutions of the Irish State
   
Introduction

Ireland is a constitutional republic, which means that the fundamental rules that determine how the State behaves, how laws are made, and how power should be used are set out in a written constitution.It also means that the people of Ireland elect who they want to represent them, govern them, and make laws on their behalf.The Irish Constitution establishes and describes the main institutions of the State. The power to run the State is divided into 3 separate branches:
The Legislature (or legislative branch)
The Executive (or executive branch)
The Judiciary (or judicial branch)
The Constitution tries to keep these powers separate to guarantee that there is not too much power in the hands of one institution of the State.
 
Separation of powers

The Irish Constitution says that all of the power of the State comes from
the Irish people. It also says that that the power to govern is divided between the
Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.The Legislature has law-making power. Only the Oireachtas (the national parliament),
with the President
as its head, can make laws in Ireland. See ëThe Legislature' below.The Executive has the power to enforce the law, run the departments of the
State and set the agenda of the Oireachtas. The Government,
led by the Taoiseach, has the executive power of the State. See ëThe
Executiveí below.The Judiciary has the power to interpret the law. The Irish courts system has this power, which includes
the power to decide if a piece of legislation or law is
unconstitutional. See ëThe Judiciaryí below.The Constitution sets out how these state powers should work, and puts in
place checks and balances to prevent institutions from having too much
power.
 
The Legislature

The legislative power is the power to make laws. The Oireachtas does this
through introducing and changing legislation.
Articles 15 to
27 of the Constitution give this power to the national parliament or the
Oireachtas. The Oireachtas comprises The D·il, The Seanad and The President.
The main function of the Oireachtas is to make new laws and amend existing
laws. New laws start as Bills, and must be debated by the D·il and Seanad and
passed by both Houses before the President can sign the bill into law. If the
Seanad does not pass a bill, the D·il can still enter the bill into law, but
must pass a resolution declaring that the Bill is deemed to have been passed by
both Houses. When a bill becomes law, it is known as an Act of the
Oireachtas.Any sitting TD (Teachta D·la, the name given to elected members of
the D·il) or Senator can publish a Bill and try to have it passed by the
House, but the Bill must have the Governmentís support if it involves
spending public money.The President has the power to refer a bill to the Supreme Court to
seek a judgment that the law is constitutional.TDs are elected in general
elections, which must be held at least every 5 years. Senators are either
appointed by the Taoiseach, or elected in Seanad elections, which take place
after a general election has been held.The Oireachtas also elects the Government and passes budgets for Government
Departments.
 
The Executive

Article
28 of the Constitution gives executive power to the
Government.Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the
assistance of the civil service,
police force and military. The head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is
nominated by the D·il.
The Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the T·naiste) and a cabinet of ministers to
take responsibility for the Departments of
Government.The Government is usually formed by the largest party in the D·il after a
general
election. A Government formed from two or more parties is called a coalition
government.The Government must have at least 7 members (which must include the
Taoiseach, the T·naiste and the Minister for Finance), and at most 15 members.
A maximum of 2 senators can be appointed as Ministers.The Government is answerable to D·il
…ireann, and will not survive without the support of the majority of
TDs.
 
The Judiciary 

The judicial power is the power to interpret and apply the law to disputes
and conflicts that arise between the State and the individual and disputes and
conflicts that arise between individuals. Articles 34 to 37 of
the Constitution give this power to the courts.Under Article 35,
judges of the courts are independent of the Government and can only be removed
through a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas for misbehaviour or
incapacity.Judges are appointed by the President,
who acts on the advice of the Government. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advises the
Government on suitable candidates for the bench.

Local government
    

Ireland has 31 local authorities that are responsible for a range of local services, including:HousingRoadsRecreation and amenitiesPlanningLibrariesEnvironmental protectionFire servicesRegister of electorsMost (26) local authorities are county councils. There are also 3 city councils (Dublin, Galway and Cork) and 2 councils that oversee a city and a county (Limerick and Waterford).Voters elect councillors to represent them at local level. You can read about how members of local authorities are elected in a range of different languages.Ireland currently has 949 elected councillors. They make policy decisions at council meetings. Local councils are managed by a chief executive who oversees the day-to-day running of the council.Local authorities are recognised in Article 28A of the Constitution of Ireland, which guarantees that local elections are held at least every 5 years.
 
What does the local authority do?

Local authorities have a number of important functions.HousingLocal authorities are the main providers of social housing for people who cannot afford their own accommodation. They own a stock of accommodation and rent houses and apartments to eligible applicants. They are also responsible for maintaining the accommodation. You can read more about Applying for local authority housing.Local authorities provide social housing support through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).Local authorities also enforce minimum standards in private rented accommodation.PlanningLocal authorities oversee planning permission. New buildings, some extensions to existing buildings, and changing the purpose or use of a building (for example, changing a shop into a restaurant) must have planning permission.RoadsLocal authorities are responsible for improving and maintaining regional and local roads. They are also responsible for:Public parking servicesTraffic wardensSetting speed limits on local and national roadsMaintaining street lightingTrimming hedges and treesDrainageGritting roads during very cold weatherLocal authorities also have a Road Safety Officer to promote the safe use of roads in the local area.Fire servicesLocal authorities operate fire services with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage playing an advisory and policy-making role.Libraries, recreation services and amenitiesLocal authorities operate a network of public libraries in Ireland. Public libraries are open to everyone and most of their services are free.Local authorities also provide funding to local youth, arts and sports services, as well as maintaining and operating public swimming pools, leisure centres and playgrounds.Many public amenities, like parks and monuments, are maintained by local authoritiesEnvironmental protection and animal controlLocal authorities play an important role in protecting the environment including:Issuing licences for industrial waste disposalIssuing licences for industrial air emissionsCollecting domestic, commercial and other waste, and granting licences to private companies to collect wasteIssuing dog licences, appointing dog wardens, providing dog shelters and taking court action against dog owners where necessaryIssuing licences to horse owners in areas that are designated as control areas for horsesLocal authorities also have a role in enforcing noise pollution laws.Register of electorsThe local authority must put together and maintain a list of voters in its area.You can find details of all local authority services in your area, at the Local Government Services site.
 
Elected councillors

The members of each local authority are called 'councillors'. Councillors are directly elected in local elections. The number of councillors elected to each local authority depends on the population of the local authority area.Local elections by law are held in the month of May or June on a day fixed by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage Each councillor holds office for 5 years, Councillors elected in May 2019 will hold office until 7 days after the polling day in 2024.The number of members of each local authority is fixed by law. This means that Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by Section 15 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, has set down the number of members of every county council, city council and city and county council throughout the country.The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage may divide each city or county area into smaller local electoral areas and may fix the number of councillors that can be elected for each of these electoral areas.Before making changes to an electoral area, the Minister requests a boundary committee to prepare a report of recommendations. View the most recent boundary committee reports.What do councillors do?Councillors make decisions at council meetings. There are 4 different types of meetings held by the local authority:An annual meeting (held in May/June each year)Ordinary meetings (usually held at least monthly)A budget meeting (usually towards the end of the year)A special meeting (held occasionally)At the council meeting, every councillor is entitled to vote for or against resolutions put forward at the meeting. In most cases, a resolution is passed where the majority of the members present vote in favour of the resolution.Resolutions and bye-lawsLocal authorities make decisions about policies by passing ëresolutionsí. Resolutions are passed by councillors and are known as reserved functions of the local authority. Resolutions can include:Decisions about annual budgetsHousing policyEnvironmental protection policiesLocal authorities can pass laws where they are empowered to do so by the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament). These laws are called bye-laws and are often used to regulate:Parking zones and parking finesLitter controlThe control of horses and dogsTwo months before making a Bye-Law, the local authority must publish a notice in a local newspaper indicating that it proposes to make the Bye-Law. The public is entitled to inspect the proposed Bye-Law and make submissions about it before it comes into effect.The Cathaoirleach of the local authorityEvery year, the local authority elects a Cathaoirleach (Chairperson) and a leas-Cathaoirleach (vice-chairperson) from the elected councillors. The Cathaoirleach chairs meetings of the local authority.In some areas, the Cathaoirleach is called the Lord Mayor or Mayor and the leas-Cathaoirleach is called the Deputy Lord Mayor or Deputy Mayor:Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor ñ Cork City Council and Dublin City CouncilMayor and Deputy Mayor ñ Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council, and Galway City Council
 
The role of the chief executive

Every local authority has a chief executive (formerly called a county or city manager) who is employed to manage their local authority. Some local authorities share a chief executive. As well as the chief executive, some councils also have deputy chief executives.The chief executive performs the executive functions of the city council, county council or city and county council. They supervise, co-ordinate, manage and pay the employees and officers of the council. They also makes contracts on behalf of the council and affixes the official seal of the council on documents.Once appointed, the chief executive will remain in office for a term of 7 years (although this can also be extended by an additional 3 years).The chief executive makes decisions on the running of the local authority, except those that are reserved decisions (decisions that are made by the elected councillors). These include:Granting or refusing planning permissionAllocating local authority housingSigning contractsManaging the staff of the local authorityThe day to day running of the local authority
 
Regional assemblies

Regional assemblies make decisions about strategic planning, EU funding and
they help co-ordinate the work of local authorities.Ireland has 3 regional assemblies. Each assembly has members who are elected
by the local authorities in the region. The 3 regions are:
Northern and Western region
Eastern and Midlands region
Southern region

Government Reform Act 2014 and have been in operation since 1 January
2015.
 
What do regional assemblies do?

The aim of the assemblies is to co-ordinate, promote and support
strategic planning and sustainable development and make local
government and public services more effective.Strategic planning means planning the direction or goals for the region, and
making decisions on how to use funding and resources. Regional assemblies make
it easier for local authorities to work together to benefit the region.Economic and spatial planningRegional assemblies plan how to use the land and resources in the region
over a long period. They have developed Regional Spatial and Economic
Strategies as part of the governmentís long term plans to meet the challenges
of population growth, climate change and a competitive economy.EU FundingRegional assemblies manage certain EU funding programmes like the European Regional
Development Fund, which is used to invest in development in the regions.

with the Standards in Public Office
Commission. They must also provide information about their lobbying
activities. It also provides a code of conduct for lobbying activities and
introduces a ìcooling-offî period during which some former officials may
not do any lobbying.You can access the Register
of Lobbying on lobbying.ie.There is no charge to register as a lobbyist or to view the Register of
Lobbying.

Access to environmental information

You have the right to obtain certain environmental information from a public
authority.To get access to environmental information you can use Freedom
of Information (FOI) legislation or the European
Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to 2018
(AIE Regulations). These Regulations give effect in Ireland to the AIE
Directive, which was adopted to give effect to the Access to Information
pillar of the Aarhus Convention.As well as giving you the right to access environmental information, the AIE
Regulations also oblige public authorities to be proactive in disseminating
environmental information to the public. Public authorities must inform the
public of their rights and provide information and guidance on exercising those
rights. They must also make reasonable efforts to maintain environmental
information and have it in a form that is accessible and can be reproduced.You can read the guidance
notes on the implementation of the AIE Regulations public authorities
must have regard to.
 
Rules

What is a public authority?A public authority is any body or organisation that has a role in public
administration and that possesses environmental information. The definition of
public authorities under the AIE Regulations is broader than under FOI
legislation. This means if an authority is not covered by FOI, you may still be
able to get access to environmental information using the AIE Regulations.
Public authorities, for the purposes of AIE Regulations, include government
departments, local
authorities, commercial and non-commercial State agencies and regulatory
bodies. The President and certain other offices are now excluded from the
definition of ìpublic authorityî for AIE purposes.If a body or organisation denies your request for environmental information
on the basis that it is not a public authority, you can query this decision,
following the steps outlined below - see ëWhat can I do if I am refused
access to information?í. What information can I access?The AIE Regulations allow you to access a wide range of information. They
allow you to access environmental information produced by a public authority,
received by a public authority and held elsewhere on behalf of the
authority.Environmental information includes information on: 
The state of the elements of the environment, such as air and atmosphere,
    water, soil, land, landscape and natural sites including wetlands, coastal
    and marine areas, biological diversity and its components, including
    genetically modified organisms and the interaction among these elements
  
Factors, such as substances, energy, noise, radiation or waste, including
    radioactive waste, emissions, discharges and other releases into the
    environment, affecting or likely to affect the elements of the environment
  
Measures (including administrative measures), such as policies,
    legislation, plans, programmes, environmental agreements, and activities
    affecting or likely to affect the elements and factors referred to above as
    well as measures or activities designed to protect those elements 
Cost-benefit and other economic analyses and assumptions used for the
    above measures and activities 
The state of human health and safety, including the contamination of the
    food chain, where relevant, conditions of human life, cultural sites and
    built structures that may be affected by the elements of the environment
  
Reports on the implementation of environmental legislation 
How will my request be handled?The public authority must respond to your request as soon as possible and
generally within 1 month of having received it. It should offer assistance to
enable you to make a request, particularly if you have literacy difficulties or
a disability.If the request is complex or a large volume of information is required, the
authority must write to you within a month and inform you of its difficulties
processing your request. It must also give you a date by which it will respond,
which must be not more than 2 months after it got your original request.The AIE Regulations require public authorities to designate information
officers to maintain registers or lists of the environmental information held,
or else provide an information point to indicate clearly where such information
can be found. Public authorities must also register and process all requests
for the environmental information that they hold.What if the public authority doesnít have the information but another
public authority may?If the authority to which you make your request does not have the
information, it may transfer your request to the authority that does have it,
and inform you of this. However, instead of transferring your request, it may
provide you with information about where to send your request. Can I be refused access to environmental information?You may be refused access to some types of information. For example, you may
be refused information about the location of an endangered species if
disclosure of this information could put the species at risk. You may also be
refused access to draft or incomplete documents, internal communication (such
as internal emails) or material that is commercially sensitive. Further details
on exemptions are available in the guidance
notes. In general, you cannot be refused information about emissions
into the environment. A request for information using the AIE Regulations can be refused if the
information is required to be made available under any other statutory
provision - for example, where a planning authority is required to publish the
information or make a planning file available.What can I do if I am refused access to information?The public authority must notify you of the refusal of your request
generally within 1 month. If you do not get a response within this time you can
assume that your request has been refused.There are reasons when you can be legally refused access to environmental
information. However, if a public authority refuses your request for
information or has not dealt with your request appropriately, you can seek an
internal review of the decision made by the public authority. If you require an internal review, you must request it within 1 month of
getting the decision.If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review you can
appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental
Information (CEI). You must appeal within 1 month of getting the reviewed
decision from the public authority. The CEI may extend the time limit if he/she
believes it is reasonable to do so. Public authorities must comply with the CEI's decisions and if necessary the
CEI can apply to the High Court to have a decision upheld. The CEI's decisions are published on
ocei.gov.ie.You (or any other person affected by the CEIís decision) can appeal
to the High Court on a point of law arising from that decision. The CEI
publishes further information on how to appeal.See 'How to apply' below for more details on requesting an internal review
or making an appeal. 
 
Rates

There is no charge for applying for environmental
information under the AIE Regulations. You may get the information
without charge, but there may be a fee to take account of the costs of
compiling and copying information. Public authorities must make publicly
available a list of fees, if any, charged for providing environmental
information. There is no charge for an internal review of a decision by
a public authority. However, if the review decides that you should get the
information you requested, you may be charged for photocopying etc.It costs Ä50 to take an appeal to the CEI, or Ä15 if
you have a medical card. If you were not a party to the original request and
are appealing a decision to release information that you feel will incriminate
you, the fee is Ä15. 
 
How to apply

You must make your request for environmental information in
writing or electronic form. Refer to the public authorityís website or
Information Unit for guidance. When sending your request, you must:
Mention the AIE Regulations 
State clearly the environmental information you want. Be as specific as
    possible - this will help your application to be processed faster and may
    reduce your costs (if any) 
Provide your contact details 
If you require the information in a specific format (such as email or
letter) you should specify which format in your request. You do not have to state your interest in making the request.

If you are an Irish citizen living abroad, you cannot be added to the Register of Electors unless you are an Irish official on duty abroad (or their spouse or civil partner).In its fifth report in 2013, the Convention on the Constitution recommended that Irish citizens resident outside the State should have the right to vote in presidential elections. This would require a referendum.
 
Facilities for voters with disabilities


There are arrangements in place for people with disabilities, illnesses, visual impairments, or reading and writing disabilities, to allow you to exercise your right to vote. You can:Change the polling station where you voteHave a companion or the presiding officer help you voteVote using a ballot paper template if you have a visual impairmentVote by postVote at a hospital, nursing home or similar institution if you live there
 
Polling station accessibility

Whenever possible, polling stations are located in buildings that are accessible to people with disabilities. Polling stations must always be at the ground floor level. Temporary ramps can be installed to facilitate access.Voting compartments in polling stations are usually designed for people who are standing up. The returning officer (the person responsible for organising the election or referendum in your constituency) must make a table and chair available for voters who need to sit down.Voting at an alternative polling stationThe returning officer will give public notice of all the polling stations in the constituency that are not accessible to wheelchair users. If you have difficulty gaining access to your local polling station, you can apply in writing to the returning officer at least a week before polling day for permission to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. In Dublin and Cork, the returning officer is the city or county sheriff. In other counties, it is the county registrar.To help the returning officer pick a suitable alternative station you should explain in your application why you cannot access your local station. If possible, you should suggest another polling station that is both accessible and convenient for you. The returning officer will send you written authorisation to vote at another polling station, usually the one that you have suggested. You should present this authorisation (along with the usual evidence of identity) when you go to vote. Once you have been assigned another polling station, you cannot vote at your local station.
 
Casting your vote

Assistance with voting at a polling stationThe presiding officer is the person who is responsible for taking the poll at a polling station. A supervising presiding officer may also be on duty ñ their responsibilities include supervising the arrangements for voters with disabilities. You can ask to see the supervising presiding officer if you need assistance.There are strict rules to ensure that the secrecy and security of the ballot are maintained. The law is specific about the types of voters who can be helped to vote, how they may be helped, and who may help them. The presiding officer has to apply the law, which is intended to make sure that you can vote the way you want to and that your vote is kept secret.Depending on the nature of your disability, you may be helped to vote in 3 ways:Companion votingAssistance from the presiding officerUsing a ballot paper templateCompanion votingIf you have a visual impairment, a disability or a literacy difficulty that prevents you from voting without assistance, you can bring a companion with you to mark the ballot paper for you. This person must be at least 16 years old and cannot:Be an election candidate or a candidateís agentHelp more than 2 people vote per electionIf the presiding officer does not believe that the person you choose is eligible to act as a companion, another person can act as your companion or you can ask the presiding officer to assist you.When a companion is assisting you, they go into a voting compartment with you and you tell them how to mark the ballot. The companion then places the marked ballot paper in the ballot box.Assistance from the presiding officerIf you have a visual impairment, a disability or a literacy difficulty that prevents you from voting without assistance, the presiding officer can help you mark the ballot paper.The presiding officer and the personation agents go with you to a part of the polling station where a conversation at a normal volume cannot be overheard. A personation agent is a representative of a candidate who supervises the polling and helps prevent electoral offences.If necessary, the presiding officer will suspend entry to the polling station and have it cleared, to ensure that nobody can hear how you vote. The personation agents are there as witnesses to make sure that the presiding officer follows your instructions. As with everyone involved in a poll, there is a statutory obligation on personation agents to keep your vote secret.The presiding officer asks how you want to vote and marks the ballot paper according to your preferences. They will read out any information from the ballot paper you may need to hear to make your decision. They then put the ballot paper in the ballot box.The law forbids a presiding officer from acting on any written instructions received from a voter. This is because someone else may have written or changed the instructions and it would make it harder to be sure that your vote was being cast the way you want.If you want the presiding officer to help you vote, you should go to the polling station well before it closes at night. The law allows a presiding officer to refuse a request for assistance during the last two hours of voting if helping one elector would prevent others from voting. This restriction does not apply to companion voting - you can be helped to vote by a companion at any time during polling hours.Using a ballot paper templateA ballot paper template is a transparent plastic device that is placed on top of a ballot paper. The template has raised print and braille on it, so that visually impaired people can vote without assistance. You can use this option if you have a visual impairment and don't want to be helped by a companion or presiding officer to mark your ballot paper.The template is used with a Freephone number that identifies the candidates in your area. If you want to listen to this information before polling day, you can get the number from your local authority or returning officer. You can listen to the information before polling day to familiarise yourself with it and/or you can use your mobile phone to call the number while you are in the polling compartment.Ballot paper templates are available at each polling station. If you tell the presiding officer that you want to use a template, you will be handed a ballot paper with the template attached to it.Raised print and Braille are used to identify the openings in the template that match the squares on the ballot paper. You mark your choices on the ballot paper beneath the template. There is a flap over each opening, so that you can close the flap when you have marked a square. When you have finished marking the ballot paper, you can detach it from the template, fold it and place it in the ballot box in the usual way.The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has information about using the template. There is more detail about the templates on ncbi.ie.
 
Applying to vote from home

If you live at home and you have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to a polling station, you may qualify to vote by post. You must apply to your local authority to be included in the Postal Voters List.If you are living in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution and you have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to the polling station, you can vote at the hospital or nursing home. You must apply to your local authority to be included in the Special Voters List.If you are on the current year's Postal or Special Voters List, you will generally get an application form in the post. If not, you can download one from checktheregister.ie. Forms are also available from all local authorities, post offices, Garda stations and public libraries. The application form includes provision for a medical certificate, which is usually only needed for your first application.Applications to be included in the register must be sent to your local authority. The local authority must receive your application by the following dates, at the latest:For a general election, 2 days after the date of dissolution of the D·ilFor a D·il by-election, 2 days after the date of the order appointing polling dayFor other elections or for referendums, 22 days (excluding Sundays and public holidays) before polling dayYou can read more about this in our page on registering to vote.
 
How to vote by post

Shortly before polling day, you will be sent the following documents:A ballot paperA receipt for the ballot paperAn envelope for the marked ballot paperA larger envelope addressed to the returning officerWhen you have marked the ballot paper, put it into the envelope marked "Ballot Paper Envelope" and seal it. You then put this envelope and the completed receipt for the ballot paper into the large envelope addressed to the returning officer, seal it and post it. The ballot paper must be posted - it cannot be given directly to the returning officer.
 
How to vote from a hospital or nursing home

Shortly before polling day, you will be notified of the day and approximate time when a special presiding officer will call to you at the hospital or nursing home to allow you to vote. This official will show you evidence of their identity and an appointment warrant when they arrive. They will be accompanied by a Garda, whose role is to guard the ballot papers (in the same way as in a polling station) and to act as an independent witness to guarantee that the voting procedure is carried out properly.Only the presiding officer and the Garda can be present when you cast your vote. The presiding officer will give you a declaration of identity, which they will witness for you. You then mark the ballot paper in secret, place it in the special envelope provided, close the envelope and present it to the presiding officer.If you need help with voting, the special presiding officer will provide it in the same way as at a polling station.
 
Proportional representation

When you vote in an election in Ireland, you are asked to give your vote in order of preference. This is because Ireland uses an electoral system called proportional representation with a single transferrable vote (PRñSTV, or PR for short).The names of candidates appear in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, along with their photographs and their party emblem (if they wish).You vote by writing ì1î or ìoneî opposite your first choice candidate, ì2î or ìtwoî opposite your second choice, ì3î or ìthreeî opposite your third choice, and so on. You can stop after indicating your first choice candidate or you can continue to give a preferential vote to as many candidates on the ballot paper as you wish.When you vote with more than one preference, you are instructing the returning officer (the person responsible for the counting of votes) that if your preferred candidate is eliminated, or elected with a surplus of votes, you want your vote to be transferred to your second choice candidate.PR is used in all elections in Ireland, including:General electionsLocal electionsEuropean electionsPresidential elections
 
Voting in a PR election

At the polling station on election day, you will be given a stamped ballot paper. The returning officer may ask to see some identification or a polling card. You cast your vote in a private space. The election candidates will be listed alphabetically alongside their picture, the name of their party (if they belong to a political party) and their party emblem (in some cases). You vote by placing the number of your choice next to the candidate or candidates that you have chosen.You can vote for as many or as few of the candidates as you wish.If you want to vote for one candidate only, you should mark the number ì1î or the word ìoneî in the box next to the candidateís name. You should not tick or mark the box with an X.Pencils will be provided, but you can bring your own pen or pencil if you wish.When you have voted you should fold your ballot paper so your vote is not visible and put the folded ballot paper into the ballot box.If you make a mistake on your ballot paper, the returning officer may give you another ballot paper. This is at the discretion of the returning officer. If you have already posted your ballot in the ballot box, the returning officer cannot give you another ballot paper.Spoiled votesBallot papers that cannot be counted are called spoiled votes. A ballot papers may be spoiled if:The ballot paper was left blankThe voter ticked or otherwise marked their preferred candidate or candidates, rather than numbering themThe writing on the ballot paper could not be understoodThe ballot paper did not have the number ì1î or the word ìoneî next to any candidateThe ballot paper was not stamped by the returning officerThe voter wrote their name or identified themselves in some wayThe order of preference was not clear (for example, the voter wrote ì3î next to 2 different candidates)The voter deliberately spoiled their paper as a protest
 
How are votes counted in a PR election?

When polling is over, all the ballot boxes are taken to a central counting place for each constituency. The count starts at 9am on the day after polling day. Each ballot box is opened separately and the ballot papers in each box are counted. The total number is compared with the total number of ballot papers issued for that box - this is done to check that ballot papers have not been put into or taken out of the box since the poll closed.The ballot papers are then sorted into piles of ballot papers for each candidate.The ballot papers are counted and sorted, and spoiled papers are rejected.The total valid poll is the total number of votes minus the number of spoiled papers.The count then takes place over a number of rounds. As candidates are elected or eliminated, the second, third (or lower) preference votes on that candidateís ballot paper are counted.Counting continues until all the seats have been filled.
 
How is the quota calculated?

To be elected, a candidate must generally reach the quota for the constituency. The last seat can be filled by a candidate who did not reach the quota if all the other candidates have been elected or eliminated.The quota is calculated by dividing the total valid poll by 1 more than the number of available seats (if there is a number to carry over, it is ignored), and then adding 1.For example, in a 4-seat constituency with a total valid poll of 25,000, the quota is:25,000 (the total valid poll) divided by 5 (1 more than the number of seats), which is 5,000. Then add 1. The quota is 5,001.
 
What happens to surplus votes?

If a candidate receives more than the quota, their surplus ballot papers are transferred to the remaining candidates.The surplus is transferred in proportion to how many second (or lower) preferences the other candidates received in the elected candidateís vote. If the second preference candidate on any ballot is either already elected or has been eliminated, then the third preference is used, and so on.If a candidate is elected at the first count, then all their votes are used to calculate the proportion of surplus that will be given to each candidate.For example:Candidate A receives 6,000 first preference votes at the first count. The quota is 5,000. A is elected with a surplus of 1,000 votes.Out of Aís 6,000 total votes, 30% gave their second preference to B, and 20% gave their second preference to C.B receives 300 votes (30% of 1,000) and C receives 200 votes (20% of 1,000)Where a candidate reaches the quota after the first count, only the ballot papers that brought them over the quota are examined (the votes that were transferred from the previous count).If 2 or more candidates are elected at the same time, then the surplus of the candidate with the largest vote is distributed first.
 
How are candidates eliminated?

If nobody reaches the quota after a round of counting, then the candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and all their votes are distributed. More than one candidate can be eliminated after a round of voting if it is clear that they cannot be elected, and they cannot qualify to have their election expenses repaid.
 
Recouping election costs

Candidates can qualify for recoupment (repayment) of their election expenses (up to a maximum of Ä8,700 at a D·il election), if they:Are electedAre not elected, but their total number of votes exceeds one quarter of the quotaThere are extra count rules to give candidates every chance of reaching this vote threshold. At a bye-election, the threshold is calculated differently to ensure that the minimum number of votes needed to qualify for recoupment of election expenses at a general election and at a bye-election in the same constituency is broadly comparable.
 
Recounts

A recount can be ordered if a candidate asks for one, or if the returning officer decides that a recount is needed.A candidate might ask for a recount of a particular count, or round of voting. This means that the votes that were counted in the last round only are counted again and corrected if necessary.A candidate might ask for a total recount, which means that all the votes are counted as they are at the time of the request. If an error is found, then all the votes are recounted from the time the mistake happened.It is possible that candidates that have already been deemed to be elected, could have their election overturned because of a recount. A candidate is deemed to be elected once they reach the quota of votes.However, once the result is declared, a recount can only happen if it is ordered by the High Court. A candidate is declared elected when the total count is complete and the returning officer has declared the results.

Planning permission

Planning permission is how you ask your local authority to agree to your proposed building work. It can be approved or refused by the local authority. The planning permission process is used to stop inappropriate building and developments and approve those that are suitable.
 
When do I need planning permission?

You will need planning permission if you are going to build a house. You may need planning permission if you want to build an extension or make other changes to your existing house. Some small extensions and conservatories do not need planning permission. You should always check this with your local authority before you start any building.You will also need planning permission if you want to significantly change how you use your land or buildings. For example, you will need planning permission to open a crËche on your property and you may need it if you are renting your property for short-term lets. There are some exceptions to this, for example, you do not need planning permission to change certain vacant commercial properties (including pubs) into homes. These exceptions are set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2021.You may also need planning permission for a modular home or building. This depends on a number of factors such as how big it is, where it will be situated and what it will be used for. A modular home is a home that is built off-site and then delivered and finished at the planned location. These homes are often known as rapid build homes as they are quicker to build. The Government is building rapid build homes in certain locations for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. Planning permission is not needed for this rapid build housing programme, but the Government must take environmental issues into account when choosing locations.Your local authority can advise if you will need planning permission and give you general advice about your application. Your local authority will also be able to tell you whether your proposals are likely to comply with the development plan for your area.What happens if I need planning permission but donít apply for it or get it?It is an offence to do work that requires planning permission, without having planning permission. This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.Types of planning permissionThere are 2 types of planning permission:PermissionOutline permissionThe most common type of planning permission is permission, which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.Outline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.You must not start building before you get planning permission.
 
How much does it cost to apply for planning permission?

You have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is Ä65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is Ä34.
