Of this number there should be 3 elected members present.   If the Chair is unable to attend, his/her place shall be taken by another elected member of the SPC.Following consultation with the Public Participation Network(PPN) and National Pillars, and taking on board the stated preferences of the elected members, (in so far as is possible), the following format for the SPCs was approved by the members of Waterford City and County Council at the September 2019 Meeting.Each Strategic Policy Committee shall meet as often as required, and at least four times a year, to deal with the business assigned to it.   Five days clear notice will be given for meetings of the SPC and where possible there will be an agreed schedule for meetings.The Community and Voluntary, Social Inclusion and Environmental representatives will be nominated by the Waterford Public Participation Network, subject to the endorsement of the environment reps by the National Environmental Pillar.

                    Cóipcheart   Comhairle Cathrach & Contae Phort Láirge Waterford County was established by the writ of John, King of England and Wales and Lord of Ireland in the thirteenth century. In the medieval period a Sheriff, appointed by royal authority, administered the county. The Sheriff was responsible for the collection of taxes, repair of castles, gaols, arrangements for court sessions, the policing of the county, the election of a Coroner and the construction of roads and other public works. The King's Judges visited twice yearly to hold Assizes with the assistance of the Grand Jury. The members of the Grand Jury were chosen by the Sheriff from among the largest landowners in the county.From the seventeenth century the Grand Jury began to acquire functions beyond the administration of justice and became involved in the provision of roads and bridges and the collection of county cess, the tax levied to pay for these works.  A limited franchise was also introduced and elections were carried out for membership of the Grand Jury. Details of the franchise legislation can be found in the collection. (GJ/30) 
Gradually they accumulated further functions.By the beginning of the nineteenth century they were responsible for a wide range of works and services including roads and bridges, lunatic asylums, county infirmaries and fever hospitals, dispensaries, courthouses and gaols. It is this period, the nineteenth century, which the collection details.
The Query Books (GJ/1-8) provide information regarding the maintenance of roads and bridges and of works such as the construction of piers and the development of the railway in Waterford County.
The Contract Books (GJ/15-18) and the Assize Presentment Books (GJ/9-14) detail the contracts for the building of roads and the other construction work undertaken in the county.
The Account Books (GJ/21-23) provide evidence of the county cess paid by individuals and the manner in which these funds were expended.
Click here to see the Grand Jury Descriptive lists.
The administrative powers and duties of the grand juries were transferred to County Councils and Rural District Councils by the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.The archives of the grand jury are a valuable resource as they provide evidence of the beginning of the county infrastructure, as we know it today. Many of the roads, bridges and piers still in use today were originally built under the aegis of the grand jury. These records also provide evidence of the building of railway lines in the county, many of which are no longer in use or existence. The accounts of the grand jury (GJ/21-25) also contain a glimpse at the social conditions of the time with entries such as payments made for the maintenance and transport of prisoners.Due to the small size of the collection, little arrangement has been carried out. It has simply been arranged with the 'Query Books' and 'Contract Books' followed by the 'Account Books' in order to show, first, the work carried out by the grand jury and then the cost of carrying out these works and services.Similar records can be found among the archives of other County Councils in Ireland.
                    The City and County Archive holds some private paper collections. These include the Chearnley Papers, which date from 1671 to 1915 and relate to the Musgrave and Chearnley families living in Salterbridge, barony of Coshmore and Coshbride, County Waterford.The archive also holds the papers of Hugh Ryan a local historian and scholar. The collection includes political pamphlets relating to Irish nationalism from 1900-1960 and records relating to a survey of the gravestones of Mothel burial ground, parish of Mothel and Rathgormack carried out by Hugh Ryan and published in Decies volumes 38-42. The collections also include the papers of Waterford Chamber of Commerce and archives in relation to Thomas Francis Meagher.Further collections of estate records, business records and private records relating to Waterford City and County will be made available to the public as the City and County Archive develops and expands its collections.The City and County Archive also provides advice and guidance to organisations and individuals who hold archival collections in Waterford City and County.Cappoquin House and Gardens holds a collection of archives and is working to preserve these archives and make them accessible. With assistance from the Heritage Council the papers of Sir John Keane (1873-1956), 5th Baronet have been boxed in archival boxes and listed by Dr. Mel Farrell.)
                    The Boards of Guardians were established under the Poor Law Act, 1838.  This Act divided the country into a number of Poor Law Unions each of which had a Board of Guardians and a Workhouse. County Waterford had four poor law unions: Dungarvan, Kilmacthomas, Lismore and Waterford City. The members of the Board of Guardians were local landowners. The Boards of Guardians were given the responsibility for the "social welfare" and public health of the people within the poor law union.The City and County Archive holds the minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Guardians. At the beginning of the meetings held each week statistics are filled in detailing the number and categories of people admitted and dying in the Workhouse. This is naturally of interest in determining the effect of the Famine in the local area. The minutes also provide information on the food consumed in the Workhouse and the manner in which the "inmates" spent their days. The minutes also provide information on outbreaks of disease in the area and events affecting the area. The Registers for the workhouses do not survive or have not been found to date, so there is no record of the admittances to each of the Workhouses.

                    Introduction
   
      
  
The causes of the First World War are many and complex. In the years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War tensions were high across Europe as countires struggled for security and power. A series of alliances were struck between countries that resulted in the spread of war across Europe and far beyond in 1914. The spark that ignited the outbreak of the First World War was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungarian throne, on 28 June 1914. It was the belief of Austria-Hungary that the Serbian government were connected to those who carried out the assassination that lead them to declare war on Serbia on 31st July 1914. This, in turn, caused Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in support of their allies, Serbia. It was this system of alliances that pulled France, Germany and Britain into the war as well. Germany in support of its allies Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia on the 1st August and on France on the 3rd of August 1914.Britain joined the war in support of its ally Belgium. In the Treaty of London 1839 Britain committed to defend Belgium and when Germany invaded Belgium in order to counter any possible movement by France, Britain called for Germany to leave Belgium. On 4th August 1914 Britain declared war on Germany following its failure to retreat from Belgium. Ireland was still part of Britain in 1914 and as a result Ireland was at war.In 1914 the focus of Ireland was on the goal of Home Rule. John Redmond, MP for Waterford between 1891 and 1918 was the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. He had successfully manoeuvered to bring the Home Rule Bill, 1914 through the House of Commons and through the House of Lords, where the six counties of Northern Ireland were to be temporarily removed from the provisions of the Act, against the wishes of Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party. Despite the abstention of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Lords, the Bill was passed and Home Rule was due to be signed into law with royal assent in September 1914 when the outbreak of the First World War intervened and postponed the enactment of Home Rule for Ireland. John Redmond called on the Irish Volunteers to support the Allies and Britain in the war effort and to join the British Army to fight.Many in Waterford responded to this call to serve and left Waterford City and County to fight and die on the battle fields of the First World War. Information on those who gave their lives can be found on the database of the Waterford War Dead. To find out more about those who served during the First World War take look through the Permanent Digital Memorial Lives of the First World War. This digital memorial provides people with the opportunity to find out more about those who served in the First World War and also to add any information they have to that memorial.The following exhibition from the archives held in Waterford City and County provides a glimpse into aspects of the First World War and life in Waterford from 1914-1918.
                    
           Waterford City and County Archives Service is an amalgamation of the City Archives in High Street, Waterford and the County Archives in Dungarvan Library, Dungarvan. The City and County Archive holds the records of local authorities in Waterford City and County, past and present and also holds private collections relating to the City and County Waterford.Archives are unique records of decisions, actions and memories and come in all formats, including, paper, digital and audio-visual. Archives provide evidence of human actions and the importance of archives has been recognised in the Universal Declaration on Archives which was adopted by the 36th Session of the General Conference of UNESCO on 10th November 2011.Visiting the Archives   
           The City and County Archive welcomes all visitors to the Archive and the Archivist and staff will provide every assistance that they can to identify the records that will be of interest to you for your research. However, the staff cannot do research on your behalf.
Members of the public may view the archives and may carry out research in accordance with the rules laid down by the archivist to ensure the safety of the archives.  We also maintain a Facebook page and a set of presentations on Slideshare. Donating and Depositing Archives

Accessing Personal Information  

Waterford City and County Archives Service holds collections of records that sometimes contain personal information about individuals and it is the policy of Waterford City and County Archive Service not to release any personal information until 100 years old. This is in compliance with the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the Data Protection (Amendment) Act, 2003.

It can be tempting to assume that when a record is closed to access there are deep, dark secrets being hidden but personal information can simply refer to the name and address of a person.

The goal of the Archive Services is to provide access to information and in the case of personal information it is still possible to access these records provided you are the person to whom they relate or that you have the permission of the person to whom they relate. If the person to whom the records relate is deceased then you must provide evidence in the form of their Death Certificate to gain access to the records. If you are researching your family history and you would like to access records you believe relate to your family then you must provide the evidence of your research showing your connection to the person/s in the records.

The Archive Service will facilitate researchers in as far as possible to help identify if the records relate to their family but cannot provide access to personal information without certainty that the records are definitely relating to the family in question. In cases where this is uncertain the records will not be accessible.

If you have any queries about accessing personal information or any of the collections in the Archives please contact the Archivist at archivist@waterfordcouncil.ieCollecting Policy of Waterford City and County Archive  
              The City and County Archive works to preserve collections of archives relating to the history and development of Waterford City and County. The records are stored in environmentally controlled conditions and care is taken to ensure they are stored and handled in a manner that ensures their long-term preservation. The goal of the City and County Archive is not only to ensure the preservation of its records but also to make these records available to researchers in Waterford and beyond. 

In general, it is the policy of the City and County Archive to collect related groups of records rather than individual items, as this ensures that the records can provide a more complete and accurate picture of an organisation, business, family estate or institution. Also, the research value of the records may be diminished if they are removed from their original source.  If you have a collection of material that you feel is of historic interest in relation to the City and County of Waterford, then please contact the Archivist.

                    The City and County Archive provides Records Management Services to Waterford City and County Council. Records have a three-stage life cycle:

Current: records are stored within the offices and are frequently required by staff in order to carry out the functions of their section.
 Non-current: records become non-current when they are needed for only occasional reference or in order to meet legal or financial obligations. When records are non-current they are taken out of the offices and stored in a Records Centre.
 Archive/Dispose: records that are no longer required by the local authority are destroyed or transferred to the Archive. Records Management Policy  
 This is the policy document for Records Management in Waterford City & County Council
Records Centre Procedures document. This document contains the relevant procedures for the Records Centre.
National Retention Policy 
The National Retention Policy for Local Authority Records is the Records Schedule used by Waterford City and County Council in common with other local authorities in Ireland. It is a Records Schedule, which states how long each stage of the life cycle lasts and states whether or not the records are to be sent to the Archive or disposed of. It was drawn up by a group of Freedom of Information Officers and Local Authority Archivists in consultation with staff in the local authorities and published by the Local Government Management Services Board in 2002.

           A census of population was taken every 10 years from 1821-1911. Unfortunately, due to the destruction of the Public Records Office in 1922 most of these censuses, up until the 1901 returns, were destroyed. Fragments of surviving, earlier census records as well as the 1901 and 1911 census records, are available online from the National Archives of Ireland. The records can be searched by the family name and by townland and the website provides detailed guidelines on how to search the census records.The Central Library and Dungarvan Library also hold microfilm copies of the 1901 and 1911 census records. When searching the census records remember to try different spellings of surnames e.g. Walsh, Welsh, Walch. In some cases the spelling may be quite different or the name was not transcribed correctly which can make the person difficult to locate by searching for the name. In these cases you can Browse the census forms online by location. In order to do this you will need to know the townland name and the Electoral Division. 
The details on the census forms can also be used to lead to the next research step. The ages given on the census forms are not always accurate but they do give a place to start when searching for birth records. The 1911 census asked how long a couple were married and subtracting this from 1911 provides the year of the marriage and can be used to track down the marriage certificate or marriage record in the parish records.
                    The Church recorded baptisms, marriages and deaths prior to the introduction of Civil Registration in 1864.Copies of the parish registers for the Catholic Church are held on microfilm and available at the Central Library, Waterford and Dungarvan Library.  
Please note that the parish registers are mainly in Latin and the quality of the writing can vary from one parish to another, with some parishes quite difficult to decipher. While we are happy to provide as much help as we can, we cannot check the parish records on your behalf. Reading the parish registers can be quite time consuming so please ensure you give yourself enough time when planning your visit.Appointments for the microfilm are available by contacting the Central Library or Dungarvan Library. Microfilm sessions are one hour to a maximum of two per day.The National Library of Ireland also hold these microfilms and have them available to researchers.  Waterford Heritage Genealogy Centre, Jenkin's Lane, Waterford City will carry out research of these records on your behalf for a fee.The parish records for the Church of Ireland are available from the National Archives of Ireland or the Representative Church Body Library at : www.ireland.anglican.org/library/libroots.htmlThe parish records for the Methodist Church are held with the Church of Ireland records and for further information see : www.wesleyhistoricalsociety.org.ukThe records of the Presbyterian Church can be consulted by contacting the Presbyterian Historical Society on their website at : www.presbyterianireland.orgTranscripts of the Register for the Society of Friends (Quaker) Waterford Monthly Meetings are held at the Central Library, Waterford. The news of births, deaths and marriages among the members were recorded at these Monthly Meetings. The records for the Society of Friends are held on microfilm at the National Library of Ireland or at the Dublin Friends Historical Library, Swanbrook House, Bloomfield Avenue, Donnybrook, Dublin 4.The records for the Jewish community are held by the Irish Jewish Museum, Walworth Road, Dublin 8.
                    Civil Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages commenced on 1st January 1864 in Ireland (registration of non-Roman Catholic marriages commenced on 1st April 1845). These records are available from the General Register Office and the website has information on research at the General Register Office. If you already have enough information to correctly identify the certificate you require, you can order a copy of a certificate online from the health Service Executive.You can also contact the Registrar, St. Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan at 058-20900 or the Waterford City Civil Registration Services, Community Services, Cork Road, Waterford at 051-842824. However, if you do not have enough information to identify the correct certificate, you will need to arrange to search the indexes at the General Register Office, search online or engage a researcher to do so for you.Death Registers

      Under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, Ireland was divided into Petty Sessions Districts which were overseen by Justices of the Peace. A clerk was appointed to each district to record the cases heard by the Justices of the Peace. The Petty Sessions Courts heard minor criminal cases and also determined whether more serious cases could go forward to the Quarter Sessions or Assizes to be tried. The records of the Petty Sessions Court are held by the National Archives of Ireland.The records of the Petty Sessions Court for Waterford City 1851-1921 are also available from Central Library, Waterford on microfilm.
Gaol Records

                    Lismore Castle Estate Emigration Database
   
      This project received funding under the European Union INTERREG IIIA Ireland/Wales Community Initiative Programme.  As the name suggests, it was a three-way project between partners Dublin City Archives and Waterford County Archive (Ireland Strand) and Gwynedd County Archives (Wales Strand).  The Celtic Trí Project aims to foster cultural connections between Ireland and Wales, exploring links between the two nations, through music, poetry, migration, sport and the spoken word, particularly the extent and use of the two Celtic languages. Family history was an important component of Celtic Trí, and all three archives services featured this in their scheduled projects, with funding being provided by INTERREG for the appointment of genealogists in each service on a contract basis. In addition, Waterford County Archive was awarded INTERREG funding for the creation of a database of records of genealogical interest and the production of a publication on genealogical sources in the County. 
      Lismore Estate Papers Emigration Record Database 1815-1905
   
      The Lismore Estate Emigration Record Database was created to facilitate the retrieval of information relating to emigration from Lismore Castle Estate during the period 1815-1905. The Lismore Estate refers to the estates of the Dukes of Devonshire and relates to lands largely situated in the counties of Waterford and Cork. Lismore Castle was and remains the seat of the Dukes of Devonshire in Ireland.Large families and few employment prospects ensured that a constant stream of applications were made to the agent of the Duke of Devonshire or in some cases to the Duke of Devonshire himself. These were recorded in Tenant Application Books or in the correspondence of the time. If assistance to emigrate was granted the payment was then recorded in the estate Account Books.The Lismore Estate Emigration Record Database is comprised of four searchable fields. The information contained in these fields is taken directly from the Tenant Application Books, from correspondence with the estate and from Account Books. Each record contains the applicant's name and address (where provided), the date of the application, the applicant's destination (where provided) and a transcript of the entry contained in each or all of the aforementioned estate records. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information supplied and in cases where it was not possible to decipher the word in the original records square brackets are given to show that the information is an educated guess rather than a certainty.Tenant Name : Data in this field is entered in the following manner: Surname [comma] Firstname 

The spelling of names has not been standardised. Therefore, when conducting a search it is essential that all spelling variations are entered. For example, if the surname O'Brien is the subject of a query, then the following variants should also be entered: Brien, Brian and Bryan. Note that prefixes, such as, O and Mac are used only sporadically in the records and therefore searches should be conducted both including and excluding them.
Townlands
   
      The spelling of placenames in this field has been standardised. The standard used is that determined by the Lismore Estate itself, where townlands are listed in formal indices. A supplemenatry list, which includes a list of those townlands whose spelling in the Lismore Estate indices differs significantly from the spellings included in the publications Liostaí Logainmneacha Port Láirge (Dublin, 1991), The Place-Names of the Decies, Rev. P. Power (London, 1907) and Townlands in Poor Law Unions, George B. Handron (USA, 1997) is available here.
      Dates
   
      This field indicates the year in which an application to emigrate was made or granted.
      Destination
   
      This field includes the country, state or city that applicant intended to travel to e.g. UK.Wales. Cardiff.

The completed database offers a searchable record of individual migration from this estate and offers a comprehensive new source for the family historian. Similarly, the database provides interesting data on emigration from counties Waterford and Cork to various parts of the world during the period 1815-1905. 
      
                    There have been a number of great estates in Waterford. These were lands owned and managed by landowners who rented out lands to tenants. The records of these estates, where they survive, can provide a great deal of information about the tenants on the estate.Estate records can include Rental Books, Tenant Application Books, correspondence with tenants and financial accounts of dealings with tenants. They are a very valuable source for researchers of family history. Unfortunately, in many cases landed estate records have not survived.See Private Papers for details of such Estate Records held by the Waterford City and County Archive. The National Archives of Ireland have some records relating to estates and the National Library of Ireland www.nli.ie also hold records of estates, these records can be searched by searching the National Library's Manuscripts collection online.Some landowners' records may be held by other archives services. In Ireland, you can check the archive portal website, IAR, where collection level descriptions are being added from archives across the country. In the UK you can check www.a2a.org.uk
                    St. Carthage's Burial Ground in Lismore was the responsibility of the Lismore Rural District Council and later the responsibility of Lismore Town Council. The Rural District Council drew up a map of plots for the burial ground and a local registrar was appointed to record the burials in the Burial Register. Unfortunately, burials did not strictly adhere to the burial plots as laid out on the map so further investigation may be required when visiting the burial ground with the details provided in the register. In addition to the Register of Interments (Burial Register) there is also a 'Register of the Purchase of Grave Space's for St. Carthages beginning 8th June 1919. As the Register of the Purchases of Grave Spaces contains information on those still living it cannot be made generally available but if you have a query in relation to your own personal information please contact the Archivist.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

                    St. Declan's Burial Ground in Ardmore was part of the Youghal Poor Law Union until its abolition when it was transferred to Waterford County Council. In 1913, Youghal Poor Law Union began to keep a 'Register of Burials' for St. Declan's Burial Ground in Ardmore. A map of new burial plots was drawn up and a local registrar was responsible for recording burials in the Burial Register.
                    The graveyard and 19th century Roman Catholic church of St.Mary's are on an east facing slope, on a corner site beside the road. The graveyard is rectangular, (c.110m E/W x c.100. N/S) and the church is set in the SE corner. The earlier graveyard extends west of the church, terraced into the slope, with 19th and 20th Century headstones. Several memorial plaques (Hartery family) are on walls of a ruined building on the south boundary.
                    St. Otteran's Burial Ground, also known as Ballinaneeshagh Burial Ground, is operated by Waterford City & County Council. It was in use from the early 19th century but only enclosed and laid out in 1877. There were a number of burials prior to the attempt to provide a plan for the burial ground. There is no register for these earlier burials. The first 426 plots on the burial register were left blank in the hope that the 'Burial Board' could fill in the details later but this never occurred. The first record from the burial register dates to 12th September 1862 and Waterford City and County Archive holds the original burial registers from 1862 until 1966 but there are some gaps. Unfortunately, burials did not always strictly adhere to the plan of burial plots laid out so further investigation may be required when searching for a plot found in the register.The Burial Registers are very large files and downloading the full register may take some time. They have also been broken down into sections. Please note you can enlarge the text on the PDF document for clearer viewing, but some entries are faded in the original register and may be difficult to decipher. To search, you will need to open the index first to get the plot number and then open the PDF for the location of that plot number.
                    St. Patrick's Burial Ground in Tramore was the responsibility of Waterford Poor Law Union and later the responsibility of Tramore Town Council. A map of the plots for the burial ground was drawn up and a local registrar appointed to record the burials in the Burial Register and purchase of grave spaces. Waterford City and County Archives Service holds a digital copy of the Record of Grave Purchases 1936-2012.As the Record of Grave Purchases contains information on those still living it cannot be made available online but if you have a query in relation to your own personal information please contact the Archivist.Waterford City and County Archives Service has collated information on the ownership of burial grounds and continues to try to locate surviving burial registers. 


Trade Directories set out to record the "principal inhabitants" of a community, particularly those in a trade or profession. Directories were put together by individuals and publishers for commercial purposes during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. They are a very useful source for researchers looking for people in trades and professions, however, they were commercial publications and not everyone chose to be included and this may be the reason why a person does not appear in a directory.
Waterford City and County Library Service have made the following Trade Directories available online as a searchable database:
How to Search the Trade Directories Database   

There are 3 possible search options:Waterford City and County Library Service also has further Trade Directories available to researchers at the Central Library, Waterford and Dungarvan Library Branches.
                    The Primary Valuation (Griffith's Valuation) was carried out 1847-1864. It was a survey of land and properties in order to determine their worth for the purpose of levying a tax known as 'County Cess' to fund local services.For an example of the information available by searching the valuation records click on our examples from Dirty Lane 1851-1951, Dungarvan.Griffith's Valuation for City and County Waterford is available online from the Ask About Ireland website.The City and County Archive holds Valuation Records for the period after Griffiths Valuation. These are records of the payment of later rates to the local authorities.In the case of Waterford County the Valuation Books date from 1869-1890s with some gaps and these are available from the Archive in Dungarvan. 
The Valuation Books are organised by baronies and within barony by civil parish and then by townland. Provided the townland name is known the information on the barony or civil parish will be located. You can search Waterford Places an online resource on the townlands of Waterford which will also provide resources and further information on the location searched for.The Local Government Ireland Act, 1898 set up a new system of local government in Ireland and instead of funding services through the cess and poor rates, services were instead funded by local rates. Rate Books record the payments of rates.Valuation and Rate Books record the Name of the Occupier, Name of Immediate Lessor, a brief description of the property, valuation of the property - house and land and the payment of rates. These records record only the Head of the Householder or Ratepayer and do not record any other people living in the property. Domestic rates were abolished in 1977.

                    Archaeology is the study of past societies through the material remains left by those societies and the evidence of their environment. All remains and objects and any other traces of human kind from past times are considered elements of the archaeological heritage. Protecting our Archaeological Heritage   

The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for the protection of our archaeological heritage, including the licensing of archaeological excavations, through the exercise of powers under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004. Monuments are protected under the National Monuments Acts in a number of ways:When the owner or occupier of a property, or any other person proposes to carry out, or to cause, or to permit the carrying out of any work at or in relation to a Recorded Monument they are required to give notice in writing to the Minister 2 months before commencing that work. This is to allow the National Monuments Service time consider the proposed works and how best to proceed to further the protection of the monument.For national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister or a local authority or which are subject to a preservation order, the prior written consent of the Minister is required for any works at or in proximity to the monument. 
                    Our built heritage is part of the environment we live and work in. This heritage is a physical reminder of the culture, ideals, and history of previous generations. Castles, country houses, churches and public buildings, some of which were designed by architects, immediately come to mind. However, more modest structures such as town houses, thatched cottages and farm complexes also contribute to the character of the county. Waterford also has a rich industrial and maritime heritage, that includes structures such as mills, lighthouses, quays which tend to be overlooked. Our built heritage is an irreplaceable record which contributes to our understanding of both the present and the past. It is ours to enjoy, to enhance and to hand on to future generations.The importance of our architectural heritage is recognised through legislation. Part IV of The Planning and Development Act 2000 deals with Architectural Heritage and each local authority has a duty to protect structures or parts of structures which are of special interest. This is done by compiling and maintaining a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) for each local authority area.The documents are a mechanism for the statutory protection of architectural heritage and these RPS documents form part of the County and City Development Plans. There are almost 2000 structures on the RPS in the City and County of Waterford, including a variety of buildings from country houses, churches, bridges, houses, shops, thatched houses and stone depots and so on. The Record of Protected Structures can be updated at any stage during the life of the Development Plan.They are an irreplaceable record, which contributes to our understanding of both the present and the past. The built fabric of our past is to be valued and we have a duty to ensure that it is conserved and passed on the future generations as a central part of our common cultural heritage.This is done by compiling and maintaining a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) for the area. Please contact Rosemary Ryall, Executive Conservation Officer with regard to these documents.


                    A protected structure is a structure or a part of a structure that a planning authority considers to be of special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view. Details of protected structures are entered by the authority in its Record of Protected Structures, which is part of the Development Plan. This can be updated at any stage during the life of the Development Plan. All up to date details will be on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).The owner and/or occupier of a protected structure is legally obliged to ensure that no danger is caused to the structure. This obligation applies from the time when an owner or occupier is notified of a proposal to include a structure in the Record of Protected Structures. At this time, the structure becomes a 'proposed protected structure'.Very few people go through the planning process without availing of the services of an Architect or other appropriately qualified individuals (referred to from here on as an Agent).   A planning consultant (agent) can guide you through the planning application process and can work with your architect where necessary to deliver a high quality and compliant planning application.  Employing a good agent guarantees a better chance of a positive result in a shorter timescale. Through their expertise, he/she will know what is required in a planning application reducing the need for a Further Information Request.The obligation to preserve a protected structure applies initially to all parts of the structure. This includes the interior, all land around it, and any other structures, and their interiors, on that land. This obligation also applies to any exterior or interior fixtures and fittings of a protected structure, or of any structure on land immediately within its cartilage.If a declaration is sought, the planning authority can clarify which, if any, parts of the structure or its surrounding cartilage are not of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, and do not require special protection.An owner or occupier of a protected structure must ensure that neither the structure nor any element of it is endangered. Endangering a structure may mean:

Under the planning system, many minor works to structures do not normally require planning permission. These works are known as exempted developments. However, for a protected structure, such works can be carried out without planning permission only if they would not affect the character of the structure, or any element of the structure that contributes to its special interest.You must seek clarification from the Planning Authority as to the type of works that would or would not materially affect the character of the structure, and which would or would not require planning permission. In the case of some structures where the decorative condition is of special interest, planning permission could be required for interior decorating, such as plastering or painting.An owner or occupier of a protected structure may request a declaration from the planning authority regarding the structure and its curtilage. This will indicate the types of works that can be carried out without affecting any element of the protected structure that contributes to its special architectural historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social and technical interest, and those works that cannot.Works that are normally exempt and do not affect the character of the structure do not require planning permission. However, owners or occupiers who carry out such works without a specific exemption in a declaration from the planning authority do so at their own risk. An owner or occupier may request a declaration from the planning authority at any time, even when not works are contemplated.Planning applications for protected structures are made in the same way as for any other planning application. However, a planning application for works to a protected structure will generally require more detail. This is because of the sensitivity of most protected structures to inappropriate works. The relevant newspaper and site notice for the application must indicate that it relates to a protected structure. Additional information on how the proposed development would affect the character of the structure must be submitted with the application. The local authority will notify other interested bodies, including the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Heritage Council and An Taisce, before making a decision.The Built heritage and Jobs Leverage Scheme 2014 is operated by the City and County Council to assist owners or occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.  An architectural conservation area is a place, area, group of structures or townscape that is either of special architectural, historical archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, or which contributes to the appreciation of protected structures. This could include a terrace of houses, buildings surrounding a palace, or any group of buildings that together give a special character to an area. In a rural setting, an architectural conservation area could include a group of structures associated with a mill or with a country house estate. An architectural conservation area can also include protected structures.  A planning authority, in its development plan, may designate an area as an architectural conservation area, to ensure that its character is preserved. Planning permission is normally required before works can be carried out to the exterior of a structure in an architectural conservation area.A planning application involving a structure in an architectural conservation area is generally made in the same way as any other planning application. The newspaper and site notice must indicate that the planning application relates to a structure in an architectural conservation area. Additional information on how the proposed development will affect the character of that area must be submitted with the application. The planning authority will notify other interested bodies, including Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Heritage Council and An Taisce, before making a decision on the application.It may be advisable to consult with your planning authority in advance of applying for permission for development, to ensure that your application is complete.

                    Waterford City & County Council, as the building control authority for Waterford, is responsible for the enforcement of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007 and Regulations made under those Acts.  The building control system applies to the design and construction of new buildings, extensions and material alterations to, and certain changes of use of, existing buildings.  The Building Control section promotes good practice in the design and construction of buildings and we do this by visiting and inspecting building sites. As far as possible, we try to resolve problems by discussing them with the builder to find an agreed solution.  Occasionally, however, we serve enforcement notices where contraventions of the Regulations occur and, in certain cases, we can and do prosecute.  As well as inspecting buildings during construction, we have the authority to examine documents, drawings and other materials relevant to the work.Primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and building owners.  The power of inspection granted to the Building Control Authority under the legislation is discretionary and does not impose an obligation on the Building Control Authority to inspect all buildings during their construction.European Union (Construction Products) Regulations (S.I. 225 of 2013)

   Recycling turns our waste materials into new useful products. This reduces the use of finite raw materials, saves energy and helps control air, water and land pollution. Recycling is a group effort. We all have our part to play to make sure our recycling is properly sorted. Recycling that includes non-recyclable items or is contaminated with food waste can end up in landfill. It only takes a few minutes to rinse out plastic, glass & tin containers and sort your cardboard to avoid a disposal problem that will live with future generations for hundreds or even thousands of years. 



On 1st January 2012, new legal requirements under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, 2010 came into force in Ireland.These legal requirements apply if you keep 6 or more female dogs which are more than 6 months old and are capable of breeding.You should contact your local authority to check if you are covered by these new requirements. Anyone who is covered by the new requirements must register with their local authority and must ensure that their premises meets the new requirements as set out in the guidelines below.Failure to register with your local authority is an offence under the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010.These new requirements may cover the keeping of dogs even when they are not used for, or never will be used for breeding purposes. Your local authority will clarify if you are covered by the new requirements.The Department of the Environment has published the following GUIDELINES on the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 which give clear guidance on the structural, operational and record keeping etc. standards required by Dog Breeding Establishments under the Act.Register of Dog Breeding Establishments

                    Microchipping of all dogs is now required by law under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 63 of 2015). From September 2015, all newborn pups are legally required to be microchipped and registered with an authorised database. This applies to all dogs from 31st March 2016.Micro-chipping is a simple and effective way to make sure that your pet can be easily identified should you become separated. A small microchip, (about the size of a grain of rice) is inserted under the loose skin on the back of your pet's neck. Your pet is registered on an authorised database that has been approved by the Dept of Agriculture, Food & Marine. A hand-held scanner at the nearest veterinary surgery or dog pound can easily read the chip when your pet is found and you will be reunited. Microchips for pets are about the size of a rice grain and are placed beneath the skin at a specific point by injection. Encoded on a the chip is a specific code number unique to the pet which is registered along with details of it's breed, sex, age and most importantly the owners name, address and telephone numbers.The main benefit of having them are that should your pet ever be lost or a dispute over ownership arise there is a quick and reliable way to establish the rightful owner. Pets can stray out of a garden when a gate is left open or if they manage to scale the wall or fence; they may be distracted on a walk and disappear away after wildlife or with other pets; sometimes they are injured while out on their own and may be brought to a vets surgery or a dog pound. In all these situations the quicker the owner can be reunited with the pet the less stress the pet will suffer. It is also very frustrating for Vets to have an animal brought in having been found wandering and having no way of identifying it although it may obviously be somebody's well loved pet.A combination of a microchip and an identity tag is probably the best solution to the problem.
                    The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 impose additional restrictions on the following breeds of dog or on strains or crosses of these breeds which have been designated as "Restricted Breeds".These dogs or crosses of them are subject by law to the following restrictions when in a public place:These restrictions do not apply to dogs used by the Gardaí, Harbour Police, Airport Police, Customs & Excise Service, Rescue teams or Guide Dogs for the Blind.
                    Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, Waterford Council is empowered to seize and impound stray horses.

Waterford City & County Council recognises the value of advertising signs to visitors, customers, businesses, community groups etc. and to the general vitality and vibrancy of an area. It also, recognises, however, that they can have a negative environmental impact as well as being a hindrance to traffic safety and safe pedestrian movement. In order to achieve a reasonable balance, it is vital that the situation with regard to advertising signage is monitored and regulated, especially signage of a temporary nature. From a legislation and regulation perspective, advertising is governed by the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011, the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2003, the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the Roads Act 1993 and the regulations applying to these Acts. It is worth noting that certain signs are exempt under the above regulations, e.g. election posters, but even these have certain conditions and limitations.The aim of this policy is to support good, creative and necessary signage in appropriate places and for appropriate events, facilities and services. It is also to ensure that the overall presentation of the city and county and the image which it portrays to residents, visitors and potential investors is not negatively affected by inappropriate and unauthorised signage. The aim is not to be anti-business or anti-community but rather to support economic activity, quality of standards and consistency in decision-making and to generally portray a positive image of Waterford.The following are some of the issues which have been identified as being problematic with regard to advertising and signage in Waterford, in the city, towns and villages and even rural locations:

                    Currently Waterford City and County Council employs one wholetime veterinary inspector and three part-time veterinary inspectors.The part-time veterinary inspectors carry out ante and post-mortem meat inspection and stamping duties in the three butcher's abattoirs in Waterford City and County which are under local authority supervision. The wholetime veterinary inspector oversees general conditions of hygiene and operational/structural matters in the abattoirs as well as being involved in the approval of low-throughput abattoirs and low-throughput meat processing plants under the EU (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 432 of 2009).Seven small stand-alone meat processing premises and two small poultry slaughtering premises across Waterford city and county are supervised and inspected by the fulltime veterinary inspector under the same legislation.The wholetime veterinary inspector also provides technical assistance to the Environment and Planning sections of Waterford City & County Council and to the Area Engineers and overseers in relation to the disposal of slaughter, tannery and other animal waste.  Assistance is also given in relation to the disposal of animal carcases and updates to staff in these areas in relation to new developments in BSE controls and other relevant matters.Waterford City & County Council is contracted to provide inspection services for low throughput abattoirs and meat processing plants on behalf of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.

                    The Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017

The Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017 came into force on October 1st 2017.  These regulations replaced the existing 2007 regulations. The objective of the new regulations is to ensure the appropriate recovery of end of life tyres.To fund this recovery, the regulations require the implementation of a visible environmental management charge (vEMC) on tyres placed on the Irish market.  The vEMC will allow waste tyres to be collected for recovery when new tyres on which the vEMC has been paid are purchased.  This vEMC must be shown separately on every invoice, catalogue, advertisement and website where the price is shown, and shall include the words "Included in these prices is a statutory contribution to recycling costs".

There is currently no vEMC charge on agricultural and construction tyres.The regulations also impose obligations on persons who supply tyres to the Irish market, whether as manufacturers, wholesalers, suppliers, traders, or retailers and on the collectors of waste tyres (including facilities dealing in end of life vehicles) to register with a compliance scheme with an approved body. The only approved body for this purpose is  Circol ELT.
Farmers who wish to obtain tyres for use in covering silage pits will no longer be able to obtain these from tyre retailers.  To obtain these they must be registered with Circol ELT to allow them receive tyres from an authorised waste tyre collector, and will be limited to 8 tyres per square metre of any silage pits floor area. Further details are available from www.circolelt.ie

Energy-Saving Booklet
       Waterford City and County Council s Climate Action Team has published an Energy-Saving Booklet, developed in direct response to the ongoing global energy crisis which is adversely impacting households and businesses.Using a common-sense approach to energy saving, the booklet is intended to act as a baseline from which actions can be taken and built upon. While many may be familiar with the tips within, old habits may prevent us from realizing their benefits. Topics covered in the booklet include energy poverty, energy supplier guidance, household appliance energy usage and home energy upgrades.WCCC  Energy Policy 2016-2030
       WCCC  has adopted and is continuing to improve upon its Energy Policy and related practices. In  line with, inter alia, the European Renewable Energy Directive as well as national law  and policy, Ireland has legally binding targets to meet in respect of renewable  energy and energy efficiency. As the technology for  generating renewable energy continues to improve, so too does the need for  clear planning, policy and objectives that are sufficiently robust to ensure  that a consistent approach to the planning and development of renewable energy  is employed at local authority level.
                    The local property tax (LPT) is annual self-assessed tax charged on the market value of all residential properties in Ireland. It came into effect on 1st July 2013 and is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.The Revenue Commissioners offer a range of methods for paying LPT. You can opt to make one single payment or spread your payments over the year. You can pay for single or multiple properties with one payment method. If you are a multi property owner, all payments and payment methods must be set up online. Anyone can make a payment for LPT once they are authorised by the liable person.Local Property Tax adjustment factor 
The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), makes specific provision that elected members of a local authority may pass a formal resolution to vary the basic rate of the Local Property Tax for their administrative area by a percentage known as the local adjustment factor. The members of Waterford City and County Council meet each year to consider this matter. They may set a local adjustment factor within the range of +/- 15% of the basic rate, or may decide not to adjust the basic rate.
Waterford City and County Council welcomes written submissions from the public on this matter specifically covering the potential effects of varying the basic rate of the Local Property Tax on businesses, individuals and on local authority services.To make your submission you can write to: Local Property Tax  Consultation, Finance Section, Waterford City and County  Council, City Hall, Waterford.  

OR Alternatively submissions can be made by email to LPT@waterfordcouncil.ie or by online submission at:    https://bit.ly/LPTAdjustment-2023. All submissions must be  received by 23rd September 2022. There is no prescribed format for  a submission.

                    The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is for people who are receiving Rent Supplement and who have a long term housing need that cannot be funded from their income. Applicants must be in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months to qualify.For more information about the Rental Accommodation Scheme, please contact our Rental Accommodation Unit at 058-22007.How does RAS work? 
           Under RAS, your local authority will help secure a longer contract of tenancy with your existing landlord and will pay rent directly to the landlord for you. You will still pay rent but you will pay it to the local authority. The rent you pay will be based on your income and will be assessed in accordance with Waterford City & County Council's Differential Rent Scheme.What are the benefits of RAS? 
          RAS will give you longer-term housing security. RAS will also ensure that the quality and standard of your private rented accommodation is adequate. Unlike Rent Supplement you can take up employment when on RAS. If you get a job, you can stay on the scheme but your rent will be reassessed based on your new income.Am I eligible for RAS? 
           You will qualify for the scheme if you have been receiving Rent Supplement for a minimum of 18 months and you have been assessed by the local authority as having a long-term housing need. RAS does not apply to asylum seekers or non-nationals who do not have permission to remain in Ireland permanently.Will I have to move to new accommodation? 
          If the accommodation in which you live meets the standards for rented houses and your landlord is willing to participate in RAS, you will be able to remain in your current accommodation. Your current accommodation must be appropriate to your housing need e.g. number of bedrooms.  If your accommodation is sub-standard and/or your landlord is not willing to engage with the scheme, you will be advised to source alternative accommodation. If your accommodation is not appropriate to your housing need you will also be advised to source alternative, appropriate accommodation.  Tenancies funded by the Rental Accommodation Scheme are governed by The Residential Tenancies Act, 2004.Does the RAS affect my rights under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2004? 
          Tenancies funded by the Rental Accommodation Scheme are governed by The Residential Tenancies Act, 2004.Where can I get more information? 
          For more information about the Rental Accommodation Scheme, please contact our Rental Accommodation Unit at 058-22007.
          
                    A key component of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is a new scheme, the Vacant Housing Repair and Leasing Initiative, which targets the delivery of social housing and also ensures that existing housing stock is used to the maximum degree possible. Waterford City and County Council have piloted and progressed the initiative with Department of Housing Planning Community and Local Government support.The basis of the scheme is that repair and improvement works to suitable vacant properties are funded to bring them up to the standard for rented accommodation and the cost of the works is then deducted from lease payments over an agreed lease term.Waterford City & County Council will assist property owners to develop the scope of works and also aid the property owner in the completion of the repair works. Property inspections are carried out by Waterford City & County Council staff who will identify the works required to bring the dwelling to the required standard. Properties in all areas will be considered but particular demand is in Waterford City, Dungarvan and Tramore. Please contact Waterford City & County Council Housing Supply Section for further details or complete and return an enquiry form, available below.

Section  48 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 (as amended) enables the Planning  Authority when granting planning permission under Section 34 of the Act, to  include conditions requiring the payment of a financial contribution in respect  of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of  the Planning Authority, and that is provided, or that is intended to be  provided, by or on behalf of the Local Authority, regardless of other sources  of funding for the infrastructure and facilities.The  Waterford City and County Council Development Contribution Scheme 2023-2029 was  formally adopted by the Elected Members of Waterford City and County Council at  its Plenary Meeting on the 9th of February 2023.Previous  Development Contribution Scheme 
             Waterford City  and County Council are responsible for dealing with derelict sites in Co. Waterford.  The Local Authority investigate reports of  dereliction and undertakes action in accordance with the Derelict Sites Act  1990.

			This Act allows local authorities to:The Derelict Sites  Act requires all local authorities to keep a Derelict Sites Register. You can view this document here.
                A Derelict  Site means any land which detracts, or is likely to  detract, to a material degree, from the amenity, character or appearance of  land in the neighbourhood of the land in question because of the following:In the event that your property/land is identified as a derelict  site, Waterford City and County Council can advise you regarding statutory  notices and the necessary repairs required, to comply with the law.

                    Where unauthorised development comes to the attention of the Planning Authority, the Planning Authority may conduct a site visit, examine the planning history of the site and may serve a 'Warning Letter' or an 'Enforcement Notice'. The following sections provide information on the various issues pertaining to planning enforcement.Please note that the information provided herein is for guidance only. It does not purport to provide a legal interpretation of the legislative provisions referred to nor can it be regarded as definitive or having any legal effect.
What is an Unauthorised Development?
   
      All development carried out requires planning permission unless it is exempted development as set out in the Planning & Development Regulations 2001 (as amended). Equally, any development carried out on foot of planning permission must comply with the planning conditions set down in the permission granted. Care should be taken to ensure that each condition of a permission is fully complied with, in order to avoid incurring enforcement action, and also to avoid difficulties when the property is being sold at a later date. In summary, any development that does not have the benefit of exempted development status, or is not being carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted constitutes unauthorised development. The Planning Authority has the power to stop unauthorised development.Who enforces planning decisions?
   
      The enforcement of unauthorised development is the responsibility of the Planning Authority, which has wide enforcement powers to ensure that either a development is carried out in conformity with planning permission, or in accordance with the exempted development thresholds as set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended).

Within the period of two weeks before making the planning application, an applicant is obliged to give notice of intention to make the application in a newspaper approved by Waterford City and County Council.  A sample Newspaper Notice and Guidelines are available here and the list of approved newspapers are  listed in this document.If your planning application is in any way inadequate or lacking in the required documentation, it will be deemed to be invalid and returned to you.

For more information on validation, please see the FAQs section.Very few people go through the planning process without availing of the services of an architect, engineer, technician or agent.

                    All development of land or property requires Planning Permission, unless it is classed as exempt.
   Exempted development is development for which planning permission is not required.  Categories of exempted development are set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2010. They usually refer to developments of a minor nature, such as small extensions to houses, garden walls and so on. It is your resonsibility to ensure that any existing or planned development falls within the exemption thresholds (size, height, etc). If the particular development exceeds the thresholds listed, the development requires planning permission.If you are uncertain whether your proposed development requires planning permission, please contact the Planning Department for more information. The following leaflets, which are available from the Planning offices, and the Department of Environment website, give details of the main exemptions:Exempted Development FAQs
   
      We have set out a comprehensive set of Frequently Asked Questions in this section.

                    There is a free pre-planning consultation service available whereby before you submit a planning application you may submit your preliminary proposals to the Planning Authority and get advice from the District Planner on the issues that may arise with the planning application. Some categories of proposed development, mainly large-scale developments, have statutory timeframes within which a pre-planning consultation must take place.  Section 43 of the Planning & Development (Amendment) Act 2018 provides that pre-planning consultation is mandatory for residential development consisting of more than 10 houses and non-residential development with more than 1,000 sq.metres gross floor space.To avail of this service please complete and submit  the pre-planning  application form together with a location map and any other details you may have.  It is essential that you attach an appropriate map which clearly outlines the location and extent of the proposal site.

As part of  measures to help address pressures in the private housing rental market,  planning legislative reforms to regulate the short term letting sector - as  provided for in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and  supplementary regulations made by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local  Government entitled the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted  Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 - came into effect on 1 July 2019.

The reforms  are primarily aimed at addressing the impact on the private rental market by  the use of residential homes for short-term tourism type letting in areas of  high housing demand. 

 Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ)These provisions apply in areas  designated as  Rent Pressure Zones  (RPZ) under the Residential Tenancies Act  2004, as amended. On 4 of June 2019, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act  2019 introduced changes to the qualifying criteria to designate an RPZ. The  qualifying criteria to designate a Rent Pressure Zone is as follows: The  Administrative Area of Waterford City and County Council qualifies as a Rent  Pressure Zone.  
Under the  arrangements applicable in Rent Pressure Zones:If you homeshare your principal private residence in a rent pressure zone and wish to avail of the new planning exemptions, you will need to register this with your local authority and fulfil specified reporting obligations:However, where  a person owns a property in a rent pressure zone which is not their principal  private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, s/he  will be required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the  property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or  short-term letting purposes.A  Frequently Asked Questions  document has been prepared to assist in providing a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the new short term letting reforms and the new reporting obligations on homesharers. QueriesAny queries  relating to Home Sharing or Short-Term Letting should be directed by email to shorttermletting@waterfordcouncil.ieCompleted  registration/notification forms can be returned by email to: Planning Department, 1st Floor, Menapia Building, The Mall, Waterford, X91 PK15
Or alternatively scan and email to: shorttermletting@waterfordcouncil.ie Enforcement
Under the Planning Act, all development, including a  material change of use, unless specifically exempted under the Act or  associated Regulations, requires planning permission.   
Planning authorities can take enforcement action if a  development does not have the required permission or where the terms of  permission have not been met.
            
Background
   
     
Under Section 6 of the Urban Regeneration & Housing Act 2015 all planning authorities are required to establish and maintain a Vacant Sites Register as and from January 1st 2017. Following assessment by the planning authority, vacant sites shall be entered on the register where they have been vacant for a minimum period of 12 months preceding their assessment, have an area in excess of 0.05 hectares, are zoned for either residential or regeneration purposes and are consistent with the following criteria as set out in the Act:In the case of residential land:
In the case of regeneration land:
The Council is currently assessing a number of sites for possible inclusion on the register with particular emphasis on sites which are suitable for housing. It is a requirement of the Act that for a site to be entered on the register details of ownership and the market value pertaining to the site are fully set out in the register.The Vacant Sites Register and Levy  
The register is now being established with all relevant data and will be fully populated in the coming months. As part of this process the planning authority will notify property owners before 1 June 2017 that their sites are being placed on the register. Thereafter, on demand being made by the planning authority, the owner of the vacant site will be liable for payment of the levy (calculated by the planning authority at 3% of the market value of the site) in respect of each year until the site is no longer vacant.  Levies will be charged every year beginning with 2018 while payment will be due in January for all levies due in the preceding year. Appeals Process  

When notified by the planning authority of its intention to include a site on the register, a property owner may object to the proposed inclusion and can make a submission to the planning authority within 28 days. Having considered the submission the planning authority may proceed to enter the site onto the register or not proceed to do so as the case may be. If the site is to be placed on the register the planning authority must notify the property owner of the decision and the owner may, within 28 days, appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála. No further action will be taken in terms of the proposed entry until such time as the appeal has been determined by An Bord Pleanála.The planning authority is obliged to determine the market value of a vacant site as soon possible after the site is entered on the register, and at least once every 3 years thereafter, and notify the owner accordingly. The owner may appeal this valuation to the Valuation Tribunal within 28 days of the notice.  Subject to the right of appeal on a point of law to the High Court, the decision of the Valuation Tribunal is final.Prior to 1 June 2018, the planning authority must notify owners of any vacant site which stands entered on the register on 1 January 2018 that the levy for 2018 will fall due in January 2019. An owner of a vacant site who receives a demand for payment of the levy may appeal the demand to An Bord Pleanála within 28 days of the date of the demand on grounds that the site is no longer vacant or that the calculation of the levy is incorrect. If such an appeal is upheld, An Bord Pleanála will instruct the planning authority to either remove the entry from the register and cancel the demand accordingly or to amend the demand so as to identify the correct amount of the levy due.Links

CCTV AuditIn October 2020, the Data Protection Commission issued a Final Decision to Waterford City and County Council in respect of CCTV audit which had commenced in 2018. BackgroundIn June 2018 the Data Protection Commission commenced an audit (own volition inquiries) of surveillance technology (such as CCTV, Body Worn Cameras and Drones) in use by public bodies. All 31 Local Authorities plus An Garda Siochana are subject to the audit. The CCTV audit commenced in Waterford City and Council in June 2018 and final decision was issued by the Data Protection Commissioner in October 2020.Since the introduction of GDPR in May 2018 the Council has implemented an ongoing programme of work across a large range of services in relation to data protection compliance. Substantial work has been undertaken in the course of this CCTV audit to enhance policies and procedures around the use of surveillance technology and improve compliance in line with the audit findings.The audit has brought to light some issues which can only be addressed at national level through changes in legislation (eg. Use of covert CCTV and Dashcams for enforcement purposes under the Litter Pollution Act and Waste Management Act).Efforts are ongoing in relation to a small number of other outstanding items including:It is hoped that all matters can be concluded in Q1/Q2 2021.

Waterford’s Digital Strategy
Waterford City & County Council has prepared a Digital Strategy to set the framework of support for communities and businesses to reap the full rewards of a digitally enabled society.	
 As part of the process, a period of public consultation ran in 2021, with an issues paper thereafter developed with feedback from the consultation and stakeholder engagement. It presented an overview of the strategy framework, set out questions and encouraged discussion that was considered in the Strategy creation. 
Local input was vital to the entire Digital Strategy process with the Issues Paper  stimulating interest and  debate resulting in constructive, positive and helpful feedback.

Strategic Issues Paper




The development of a digital strategy for Waterford commenced back in early 2018 when a steering group was formed. The four main themes of the digital strategy; are:

Digital Infrastructure
Citizen/Community
Digital Economy
Digital Council


The working group is charged with developing objectives and actions for the Digital Strategy Implementation Plan under each theme and contributing to the Digital Strategy Report. Waterford’s Broadband Officer is coordinating the digital strategy through the working group and the Department of Communications (DCCAE), the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) and their appointed consultants to deliver our local digital strategy.

A digital readiness assessment was completed in 2018, followed by training at national digital strategy workshops which led to the creation of guidelines for development of local digital strategies. These guidelines are helping to progress to report completion by laying out a strategy roadmap.

Dungarvan has a long history of local administration.An Act of Parliament held under Edward IV in 1463 at Wexford refers to 'The Portreeve and Commons of the Town of Dungarvan'. On 4 January 1609/1610 James I granted a charter to Dungarvan stating that there should be a corporate body within the borough consisting of a Sovereign, Brethren and Free Burgesses. However, by the end of the seventeenth century it appears that the corporation ceased to function in Dungarvan.Local government in Dungarvan was reintroduced when a town meeting was held in order to adopt the Town's Improvement Act 1854. The first election of the new Town Commissioners was held in the Magistrate's room in the Courthouse on 29th January 1855.On 8th June 1863 the Dungarvan Harbour, Markets and Improvement Act 1863 was passed. This act enabled the Dungarvan Town Commissioners to extend and regulate the markets of Dungarvan and allowed for the transfer of the management of the roads and bridges in the town from the Waterford Grand Jury to the Dungarvan Town Commissioners. The Act allowed the Commissioners to hold property and lands, to act as a Harbour Authority and collect Harbour dues. It also allowed the Commissioners to collect rates, borrow money and have control of the markets and roads within the town.Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 local government in Ireland was reorganised and Dungarvan became an urban district. Local elections were held and new Urban District Councillors were elected. On 23rd January 1899, the first meeting of the Dungarvan Urban District Council was held.The Minute Books for the period 1855-1900 detail the work of the Town Commissioners, recording the improvements on the town of Dungarvan, the work of the Commissioners as a harbour authority and the functions of the Town Commissioners as a sanitary authority under the Public Health Act, 1875. The Commissioners dealt with and oversaw the maintenance of the roads, harbour, markets, waterworks and provided artisan's dwellings under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.Following the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 the Minute Books detail the work of Dungarvan Urban District Council. It is of interest to note that the same Minute Book (UDC/1/8) was used to record the last meetings of the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and with the turn of a page was used to record the first meetings of the Dungarvan Urban District Council.The Minutes for the meetings of Dungarvan Urban District Council record the elections of councillors, the striking of rates, the provision of housing and sanitary services for Dungarvan, the maintenance and improvement of the harbour and town and the resolutions of the urban district councillors. Click here for a sample of Minutes.The Minutes of the Meetings of Dungarvan Town Commissioners and Dungarvan Urban District Council are an invaluable record for the town of Dungarvan. The developments of the town can be traced under both administrations and the growth of the town is clearly recorded. Events of local, national and international significance are also recorded.  The heroic sea rescues and tragic losses at sea are recorded within the pages of the Minute Books. The presence of Belgian refugees in Dungarvan during the First World War was recorded in the minutes (UDC/1/11) and a concert in aid of the Belgians was held in the Town Hall in Dungarvan on Monday 7th December 1914.The allegiance of the Urban District Council to DÁil Ãireann was recorded in the Minutes of the Dungarvan Urban District Council. The arrest of Patrick Whelan, urban district councillor, by the British authorities was recorded (UDC/1/12). The Urban District Council (UDC/1/18) supported the stance of Eamonn de Valera in maintaining the neutrality of Ireland during the Second World War. The visit of the mayor of Chicago to Dungarvan in 1964 is recorded in the minutes (UDC/1/19).  The Minute Books of the Town Commissioners and Urban District Council were maintained by the Urban District Council in the Town Hall, Friary Street until the Urban District Council moved to new premises in the Civic Offices, Dungarvan. At this time the Minute Books and other records were boxed and transferred to the Waterford County Archive Service.Little beyond the Minute Books survive for the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and the records of the Town Commissioners and the earlier Corporation may have been lost when the old Market House in Lower Main Street was sold by the Duke of Devonshire in 1861. Records relating to Dungarvan Corporation may be found among the Lismore and Chatsworth papers due to the close association between the Corporation and the Dukes of Devonshire.Further records in relation to the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and the early days of the Dungarvan Urban District Council were destroyed in the 1950s during an over enthusiastic cleaning of the Town Hall in Friary Street.However, there are a number of early files and maps among the records retained in the Town Hall, which were then transferred to Waterford County Archive Service. In 1990 Dungarvan Museum came into the possession of the papers of John Hunt of Bayview House, Ballinacourty, Dungarvan who had been solicitor for the local authority in Dungarvan from c. 1870 - c. 1920 and these are available to researchers at Waterford County Museum, Old Town Hall in Friary Street, Dungarvan. You may also want to check out the award-winning Waterford County Museum website.

Click here for the Library Catalogue.This calendar is invaluable as it contains a detailed account of the minutes allowing for a quick search for information. It also contains the only record of a volume UDC/1/6 for the period 16 April 1883-27 June 1888 which was not found among the material boxed and transferred to the Archive Store from the old Town Hall.

1923 continued  to be a time of turmoil in Waterford as farm labourers went out on strike and  unions throughout the city and county were on strike fighting for better pay  and conditions in the new Free State. Efforts were being made to rebuild and to  get the economy and infrastructure back up and running. Â A general election was held in August 1923 and  the first steps were being taken in creating a new nation through membership of  the League of Nations. This was a time of change with lots to explore about the  Decade of Centenaries.

ONLINE TALKS SERIES: Waterford in 1920
As part of its Decade  of Centenaries events Waterford City and County Council is delighted to make  available this series of talks exploring 1920 in Waterford and the voices that  were fighting to be heard in the creation of a new Ireland ... an independent Ireland.Waterford and the 1920 Local  Elections: Fighting for a Voice and a new Ireland1920 was a very turbulent year for local authorities in Ireland. It was an election year for  local government and newly elected councils, including Waterford Corporation  and Waterford County Council, immediately pledged their allegiance to DÁil  Ãireann. This resulted in the withdrawal of funding by the British Local  Government Board; raids on local authorities and the arrest of elected members  and staff.Â  Local authorities struggled  to collect rates but continued to provide services as best they could and  maintained their commitment to DÁil Ãireann. This network of local political and  administrative support was an important part of the success of DÁil Ãireann and demonstrated the commitment of the Irish people to the goal of an independent  Ireland. At the same time local  government was pledging to DÁil Ãireann a new courts system was established for the nascent state, operating under the radar and parallel to the official courts system and were soon leaving the officially sanctioned courts with no cases as the Irish people moved to have their voices heard and their legal cases handled in the DÁil Courts. 1920 also saw significant labour unrest and what has been referred to as a Waterford “soviet” was fighting to have its voice heard. Cumann na mBan too were hard at work in  Waterford in 1920, supporting and serving the War of Independence and trying to make a place for women in the new Ireland they were struggling to create.

There are however, many burial grounds for which no burial registers survive, many burial grounds that are closed, or some that are not in the ownership of the local parish. Local community groups and Solas (FÃS) have worked together to clean and record the information from headstones in a number of burial grounds throughout the City and County. The information from this work has been collated and is available in a searchable online database at Waterford City and County Library under the title "Grave Inscriptions Database".Other digitised resources
As 'Sanitary Authorities', the Board of Guardians in the Poor Law Unions, who ran local workhouses, also became responsible for the operation of some of the burial grounds in the City and County. The City Council also operated as Sanitary Authority, as were the Grand Jury and Dungarvan Town Commissioners. In the early twentieth century, the new County Council, Rural District Councils and Urban District Council established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, acting as Sanitary Authorities, opened new burial grounds or took over responsibility for some older grounds. These burial grounds became the responsibility of Waterford County Council or of the Town Councils when the Rural District Councils were abolished in 1925.Waterford City and County Archives has digitised the burial registers that survive from these authorities. The burial registers have been provided as PDF documents (there is not a search facility) but where there is an index in a register, this can be used to locate specific entries. Maps of each of the burial grounds have also been provided. You can click on each of the maps provided and enlarge them to enable individual plot numbers to be visible on the map.Thompson's Funeral Books

Purple Flag Waterford partnering with WIT Students Union and working with local venues launched an âAsk For Angela’ campaign - a simple code-word campaign for people feeling unsafe while on a night out.  The campaign welcomed by local venue owners and managers as a positive step in raising the perception of safety in Waterford, will be fully in place for the busy Christmas party season. Eric O’Brien, Chair of the Purple Flag Working Group outlined that the 'Ask for Angela' campaign gives assurance that where required, informed assistance is available. He commended the support shown by venues who will display campaign posters encouraging those in a situation where they feel vulnerable to approach staff and ask for 'Angela'  - this code word will alert staff that help is needed to  get out of a situation discreetly. Angela was a play on the word (guardian) Angel. The posters are up in male and female toilets, and provide reassurance there is support available if needed." The campaign has got global attention since introduced by Hayley Child in Lincolnshire, England in 2016.Michael Murphy, President of WIT Students Union commented that "the âAsk For Angela’ campaign has the potential to make Waterford a safer place by encouraging people to discreetly ask for help by going to venue staff and 'Ask for Angela' - a phrase aimed at alerting staff so they can help defuse a situation. It is encouraging to see so many local businesses engaging with the campaign, all with a common objective to protect people who find themselves in vulnerable or distressing situations".

  To help Ireland reach the 2020 and 2030 goals of reducing CO2 emissions by 20% and 30% respectively, energy efficiency measures are key in order to reach those targets. As well as using energy saving tips they are major changes that can be made to Irish homes involving renewable technology. With the help of SEAI grants and the cost savings on bills such as heating and electricity, home renewable technologies are a cost effective way of upgrading a house energy rating. Ireland have a binding contract with the EU that by 2020, 20% of our total energy will be renewable and by 2030, 35% of our total energy will be renewable. Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are continuously replenished. As well as being constantly replenished, renewable energy can be utilised without damaging the environment. Home renewable technology is considerably well developed and is constantly improving and becoming more efficient.
To help Ireland reach their renewable and CO2 targets, the following fact sheets have been prepared to provide homeowners with information on the available technologies and efficiency measures to help save energy costs and to improve the energy efficiency of houses. Energy-Saving Booklet
                Waterford City and County Council’s Climate Action Team has published an Energy-Saving Booklet, developed in direct response to the ongoing global energy crisis which is adversely impacting households and businesses.Using a common-sense approach to energy saving, the booklet is intended to act as a baseline from which actions can be taken and built upon. While many may be familiar with the tips within, old habits may prevent us from realizing their benefits. Topics covered in the booklet include energy poverty, energy supplier guidance, household appliance energy usage and home energy upgrades.Energy Efficiency Low Cost Tips:
			  
			  There are lots of ways to make home more energy efficient and comfortable. See fact sheet 1 to view what small changes can be made that go a long way. Thermal Insulation/Windows & Doors:
			When a building is well insulated, not only does it save money but it makes living more comfortable. For the different types of insulation and draught proofing methods see fact sheet 2 and fact sheet 3. Heating system/ Domestic Hot Water:
		    Having an efficient heating system, reducing the amount of hot water used and the efficiency at which the water is heated is vital to reducing energy costs in the home and the impact it has on the environment. To see how to get the best out of heating see fact sheet 4. Lighting Efficiency Upgrades:
			Energy efficient lighting is the simplest change a householder can make to save energy. Savings in lighting energy usage can be as high as 85% compared to traditional lighting. To see the cost savings of efficient lighting see fact sheet 5. Energy Label:
			  
Labelling helps consumers to choose the most energy-efficient products, lowering energy bills and reducing impact on the environment. To understand how an energy label can help improve consumers choice see fact sheet 6. Heat Pumps:
		Heat-Pumps can help reduce energy costs for space heating and hot water production between 40-60%. To see the different types of Heat-Pumps and the cost savings when compared to traditional heating, see fact sheet 7. Energy Performance of Building Directive:
	Building Energy Rating is an indication of energy performance of a dwelling. Before availing of the SEAI grants for energy schemes a BER is required. To learn more about BER, see fact sheet 8. Solar Heating:
	Even with Ireland’s overcast climate, solar heating is still an extremely viable option. The benefits of solar water far outweigh the upfront cost of the system. To learn about grants and the cost savings of solar heating, see fact sheet 9. Wood Fuels:
	Using wood biomass offers a renewable alternate to fossil fuels as its a carbon neutral process and will also create many jobs in the sector. To find more information on wood fuels, see fact sheet 10. Building Air Tightness:
	As well offering protection against dampness, air tightness ensures proper ventilation and sound protection. To find ways of improving air tightness, see fact sheet 13.

Our team are happy to discuss any balances  outstanding on your rates and what steps can be taken to ensure compliance with  the scheme.Why do we charge Commercial Rates?
	     Commercial Rates are a property-based source of income for local  authorities. Rates are a statutory charge, the income from which is used to  part-fund the annual revenue (day-to-day) expenditure of the local authority.  Rates originated in the 19th century and are essentially a property  tax on commercial premises. 
There are currently three primary sources of local government financing  which are universal amongst most countries. They are:
     
Central Government; Grants
Charges for Goods and Services and
Commercial Rates


Commercial Rates is one of the primary sources of Local Government funding and the income from Commercial Rates underpins the entire range of services  provided by local authorities. Commercial Rates are payable in equal moieties, the first on receipt of the demand, and the second on 1st July each year.  Revenue Collectors have responsibility for the collection of Commercial Rates in Waterford City & County Council.

How are Commercial Rates Calculated? 
  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is the figure used to calculate the annual Commercial Rates payable by the Occupier of a rateable property each year. This figure is determined by the elected members of the Council at the annual budget meeting each year, based on the deficit between Council income and expenditure for the forthcoming year. For 2023, the Annual Rate on Valuation is 0.2863. The Annual Rate on Valuation figure is multiplied by the Valuation amount of the premises as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.
For example: If your property has been valued at 20,000.00 by Tailte Ãireann (formerly known as Valuation Office) then your Commercial Rates bill for 2023 will be: 20,000.00 X 0.2863 (ARV for 2023) = €5,726.00
Disclaimer: The Rates Calculation provided above gives you a sample rates liability for 2023.

What can I do if I am unhappy with the rates I am paying for my property?
The valuation of a property is determined by the Commissioner of Valuation (Tailte Ãireann (formerly known as the Valuation Office), Irish Life Centre, Abbey Street Lower, Dublin 1). No alteration can be made to the rates assessment of a ratepayer until such time as the valuation of a property is amended by the Commissioner of Valuation. A ratepayer of the Council can seek to have the valuation on a property revised.

What happens if I don’t pay my Rates?
Failure to pay your Rates by the specified period will result in legal proceedings being issued, followed by a  Court Summons/Civil Proceedings. The Council may also register the debt as a judgement mortgage on a property. 

What is a Set off on Account (contra-entry)?
A situation can arise whereby a Commercial Rates customer will also be a supplier of goods or services to Waterford City & County Council. Should a situation arise whereby Waterford City & County Council owes money to a Commercial Rates customer for goods supplied or services rendered and at the same time Commercial Rates are outstanding from that customer, the local authority reserves the right to apply a setoff (contra-entry) on account. This effectively allows for the payment of rates to be funded by way of amounts owing by the local authority to the rates customer. Section 58 of the Local Government Act 1941 facilitates this action.

What is Entry Year Property Levy?
The Entry Year Property Levy (PEL) is a charge which the local authority applies to newly erected or newly constructed properties pending the levying of commercial rates. It was introduced for the first time in 2008 under the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, which was enacted on the 24th December 2006.
PEL is  only charged in the year before the property becomes active in the Rate Book.

How is the Entry Year Property Levy Calculated? 
The charge is calculated by reference to:
Rateable valuation on the property as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.

The annual rate on valuation (ARV) as determined by the Council.
The date (entry date) the property is valued for rating purposes (i.e. entered in the valuation list).
The number of days from the effective valuation date to the end of the year


Rates are payable on vacant premises, however  application may be made for vacancy relief if the premises is vacant and  available for let, or alternatively vacant for the purpose of carrying out  repairs or alterations. 
Vacancy Relief (vacant for a full calendar year) Vacancy relief has been available as follows: When a property is vacant for a  partial year, relief is granted on a pro rata basis per month i.e. 1/12th  of the annual vacancy relief applicable would be issued per month of vacancy. Application can be made online here or using a paper  form.  
All relevant back up documentation must be submitted with the application.
All applications will be reviewed on an individual basis. Granting of relief  will be contingent on adequate details being provided.What happens if there is a Change of  Occupant mid-year?
			  
 Owners of Commercial Properties are now obliged to notify the Local Authority, within 14 days of the transfer date, where there is a change in occupation of their property, i.e. when there is a change in tenancy or where a property is being sold, including where a property becomes vacant. The person transferring the property, either the owner or occupier are legally required to discharge all commercial rates for which he/she is liable at the date of transfer. 

Owners must complete a Section 11 Form within 14 days of the change taking place. Owners who do not notify the local authority within 14 days will incur a financial penalty. This penalty is an amount equivalent to up to two years of outstanding rates from the previous occupier. Any penalty due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property due to non-notification will remain a charge on the property. The penalty charge is not affected by the subsequent payment of the outstanding rates and it remains payable even after the outstanding rates have been paid.

All ratepayers are reminded that they are legally required to pay all commercial rates due from them prior to their departure from a property or prior to the sale or transfer of an interest in a property.  Any rates due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property will remain a charge on the property.


What can I do if I am unhappy with the rates I am paying for my property?
The valuation of a property is determined by the Commissioner of Valuation (Tailte Ãireann (formerly known as the Valuation Office), Irish Life Centre, Abbey Street Lower, Dublin 1). No alteration can be made to the rates assessment of a ratepayer until such time as the valuation of a property is amended by the Commissioner of Valuation.

What happens if I don’t pay my Rates?
Failure to pay your Rates by the specified period will result in legal proceedings being issued, followed by a  Court Summons/Civil Proceedings. The Council may also register the debt as a judgement mortgage on a property. 

What is a Set off on Account (contra-entry)?
A situation can arise whereby a Commercial Rates customer will also be a supplier of goods or services to Waterford City & County Council. Should a situation arise whereby Waterford City & County Council owes money to a Commercial Rates customer for goods supplied or services rendered and at the same time Commercial Rates are outstanding from that customer, the local authority reserves the right to apply a setoff (contra-entry) on account. This effectively allows for the payment of rates to be funded by way of amounts owing by the local authority to the rates customer.

	     Commercial Rates are a property-based source of income for local  authorities. Rates are a statutory charge, the income from which is used to  part-fund the annual revenue (day-to-day) expenditure of the local authority.  Rates originated in the 19th century and are essentially a property  tax on commercial premises. 
There are currently three primary sources of local government financing  which are universal amongst most countries. They are:
     
Central Government; Grants
Charges for Goods and Services and
Commercial Rates


Commercial Rates is one of the primary sources of Local Government funding and the income from Commercial Rates underpins the entire range of services  provided by local authorities. Commercial Rates are payable in equal moieties, the first on receipt of the demand, and the second on 1st July each year.  Revenue Collectors have responsibility for the collection of Commercial Rates in Waterford City & County Council.

How are Commercial Rates Calculated? 
  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is the figure used to calculate the annual Commercial Rates payable by the Occupier of a rateable property each year. This figure is determined by the elected members of the Council at the annual budget meeting each year, based on the deficit between Council income and expenditure for the forthcoming year. For 2023, the Annual Rate on Valuation is 0.2863. The Annual Rate on Valuation figure is multiplied by the Valuation amount of the premises as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.
For example: If your property has been valued at 20,000.00 by Tailte Ãireann (formerly known as Valuation Office) then your Commercial Rates bill for 2023 will be: 20,000.00 X 0.2863 (ARV for 2023) = €5,726.00
Disclaimer: The Rates Calculation provided above gives you a sample rates liability for 2023.

Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended by E.C. Directive 97/11/EC, requires that certain public and private projects require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before development consent is given. The type of projects listed in Annex I and Annex II of the Directive include factories, chemical installations and pharmaceutical plants, textile, leather, wood and paper industries, intensive pig-rearing and poultry installations, etc. The European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 to 1999 were made by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government incorporating the E.C. Directive into Irish law. These Regulations have been subsumed into the Planning & Development Regulations, 2001 which list the developments which must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).Consultation with the Planning Authority is advisable prior to submitting an application for permission where an EIS is or may be required. Where an EIS is applicable, six copies of an Environmental Impact Statement must be submitted as part of the application.  Natura 2000 sites are those identified as sites of Community importance designated under the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora) i.e. a Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), or the Birds Directive (Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds) i.e. Special Protection Areas (SPAs).The Habitats Directive requires Appropriate Assessments (AA) to be undertaken where a plan or project, which may not be directly linked to a Natura Site but which may give rise to significant effects upon a Natura 2000 site. Therefore where a proposed development is likely to have adverse effects on the integrity of a ânon-priority’ site of international importance for nature conservation, permission should only be granted where there is no alternative solution and where there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest in favour of granting permission, including those of a social or economic nature.  For any works proposed to be carried out to Protected Structures (PS) as identified on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) or proposed Protected Structures, a detailed Architectural Conservation Impact Report and associated Method Statement shall accompany a planning application.Where planning applications involve works to or redevelopment of a building or structure identified on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) the Planning Authority may require an Architectural Heritage Impact Assessment to be prepared commensurate to the nature and scale of the proposal. Where development involves Architectural Conservation Areas (ACAs), the Planning Authority may require an Architectural Impact Assessment to be carried out in order to ensure the protection from inappropriate actions which could materially affect the external character. For development within Archaeological Sites and in Zones of Archaeological Potential, the Planning Authority will have regard to the view and recommendation of the National Monuments Service and other interested bodies, such as the Heritage Council.   The Planning Authority may request additional information in order to adjudicate on the planning application through a Further Information Request. In this case, the applicant has 6 months to respond to this request. The Planning Authority must make its decision within 4 weeks of the date of receipt of a full response to the request.In some cases a Request for Clarification of the further information submitted may be made and in this case the applicant must submit clarification within 6 months from the date of the initial Further Information Request. In cases where an Environmental Impact Statement has been submitted as part of the application, the timescale for making a decision on foot of the further information received is 8 weeks, rather than the usual 4 weeks. The period can vary, particularly if the Planning Authority seeks further information from the Applicant (which must be done within the first eight weeks). The Planning Authority has then four weeks from the day the further information is received to make a decision on the application. /

The timescale of the decision process is dependent upon the validity and completeness of the application and the possibility of the local authority decision being subsequently appealed to An Bord PleanÁla. There is a time limit of eight weeks from when a valid application is lodged to a decision being given by the planning authority. The planning authority may issue a decision on the application (grant or refuse permission) or they may request further information. If the Planning Authority requests further information, it has four weeks from the day the further information is received to make a decision on the application (unless the application is accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement, in which case, the time for making a decision is extended to 8 weeks. Any appeal of the decision must be submitted within four weeks of the local authority decision to An Bord PleanÁla which has an objective to decide appeals within 18 weeks of receipt.The following list illustrates the timescale adhered to for most planning applications.The standard duration of a planning permission is:In accordance with Section 28 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 as amended and regulations made there under, the Planning Authority may, in certain circumstances extend the life of a planning permission. You can apply to the Planning Authority for an extension of duration of a planning permission within one year from, and prior to the expiry date of the permission.  Please note that if your development is not substantially complete and includes a waste water treatment system and if your permission was assessed prior to the implementation of the EPA Code of Practice, then your application for extension of duration will not be considered favourably unless an application to upgrade the septic tank/waste water treatment system in accordance with the EPA Code of Practice is submitted to and granted by the Planning Authority prior to submitting an application for an extension of duration.The application form for an extension of duration is available here.Ireland's planning system was introduced on the 1st October 1964, when "The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963" came into effect.We are unique among European countries in that we have an independent third party planning appeals system which is operated by An Bord PleanÁla.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for planning legislation. For more information and to download the relevant planning legislation documents, please visit here.On receipt of a final grant of permission, should you wish to commence development you are required to lodge a Commencement Notice.Please note that in accordance with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations S.I. 9 of 2014, from 1st March 2014 new Commencement Notice procedures apply.Full Commencement Notice 

The new requirement will apply to:Short Commencement Notice 

A âShort’ Commencement Notice may be submitted for the following categories of development:Yes, help is available from the following sources.
                               Once a planning application is lodged, it is checked by the Planning staff to confirm that all necessary forms, plans and maps have been submitted. 
If the application form is not fully completed, necessary documentation is absent or incorrect information is submitted, the application will be deemed invalid and will be returned to the applicant. To avoid this, please ensure that each section of the application from is appropriately completed and signed, entering n/a (not applicable) where appropriate.  Also, please ensure that all necessary additional documentation is enclosed with the application form. For assistance in completing the planning forms, guidelines are included in the Planning Application Form pack. Once it is confirmed that an application is compliant with the statutory requirements and that all necessary documentation has been submitted, the application is considered valid. The 5-week submission period and the 8 week decision period commences from the date of receipt of the valid application.The Planning Authority welcomes pre-validation meetings with a validation officer for larger applications. Typical applications which may require a pre-validation meeting are applications for housing estates, applications which require an EIS, etc.You can check if there is an existing planning permission on the site or previous applications made on/adjacent to the site using the online map or text based Planning Enquiries System. Alternatively, you may also apply for the Planning Authority to carry out the planning history search on your behalf. To avail of this service, on the receipt of a request letter, an accompanying site location map (which clearly identifies the extent of the site) and the prescribed fee (€100 payable by cheque or credit card) you will be issued with a planning history report for the site within 4 weeks. You should ensure that you have answered the following questions: 
                    
The Forward Planning section deals with the preparation of the planning policy documents, strategies and statutory/non-statutory land use plans for urban and rural areas across Waterford. These seek to deliver proper planning and sustainable development of the city and county, promote and facilitate the development of sustainable communities and enterprise, and ensure the protection of the natural and built heritage and amenity of the county, in a manner consistent with the vision and strategic outcomes underpinning the Waterford City and County Development Plan 2022 - 2028. The main policy documents and spatial land use plans consist of theÂ Development PlanÂ and subsidiaryÂ Local Area Plans.Waterford City and County Development Plan 2022 - 2028The Council has completed the process of replacing the Waterford City Development Plan 2013 â 2019, Waterford County Development Plan 2011 â 2017 and Dungarvan Town Development Plan 2012 â 2018, Â with the new unitary Waterford City and County Development Plan 2022 â 2028 which will shape the future growth of the City and County for the periods of 2022 â 2028.Details of all public consultation, and documentation relating to the draft plan and material alterations to the draft can be found on our Development Plan page.Waterford AIRO ReportA socio-demographic indicator profile of Waterford City and County based on Census 2016 and interim data to 2020 was commissioned by the planning department to inform the new city and county development plan. The document is incorporated in Appendix 18 of the city and county development plan and cacn be accessed via the plan documents or via the link below. 
                    
Local area plans for the towns of Tramore, Portlaw and Lismore for the period 2014-2020 were made by the Elected Members of Waterford County Council on 10th February 2014. The plans were prepared in accordance with the requirements set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and the relevant local area plan ministerial guidelines. The plans replaced previous local area plans for 2007-2013.The local area plans have been superseded by the land use zoning and other provisions of the Waterford City and County Development Plan 2022 â 2028. The city and county development plan commits to preparing new local area plans for the following areas during its lifetime:The new local area plans will be prepared in line with the legal provisions of Chapter II of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and will be informed through a process of public consultation. The local area plans will incorporate the land use zoning objectives and higher-level strategies as set out in the city and county development plan while focussing on issues relevant to the local context.Copies of previous local areas plans, development plans and other non-statutory land use plans may be found on theÂ Archive Folder. 

Waterford City and County Council has completed the Part 8 planning process for the Waterford City Centre Urban Renewal Scheme works.

The scheme was passed by resolution of Council at the Plenary Meeting dated 12th November 2015. The Chief Executive’s report can be found below which includes the submissions received and amendments to the scheme:This project is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the Southern & Eastern Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 as part of the Designated Urban Centre Grants Scheme (DUCGS).Broadly speaking, the works will consist of:

The Covering of the Applemarket 
The covering will consist of a reflective canopy ceiling over the central triangular area with higher glazed coverings to the edges and over John Street to provide sheltered seating areas on the three sides of this triangular âsquare’.

Repaving and Resurfacing 
The repaving and resurfacing of the street surfaces as well as the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and in some cases, public art pieces.
Changes to traffic layout in the city centre, including the provision of measures to improve pedestrian, cycle and public transport access and to minimise unnecessary 'through' traffic
The full nature and extent of these works is set out in the attached proposals and the description below.This submission has been prepared by the design teams in close collaboration with the architectural and engineering services of the Local Authority.The public realm design team consists of DHB Architects Ltd, design team leaders with Frank Fox and Associates, Civil and Structural engineers; Douglas Carroll Consulting Engineers, Mechanical and Electrical consultants; Nolan Construction Consultants, Quantity Surveyors, and Ove Arups and Partners, Lighting Design Consultants.The traffic management design team was DBFL Consulting Engineers. 

Generally, you need planning permission for any development of land or property, unless the development is specifically exempted from this requirement. The term 'development' includes the carrying out of works (building, demolition, alteration) on land or buildings and the making of a material (i.e. significant) change of use of land or buildings.To apply for planning permission, an applicant should submit a completed 'Standard Planning Application' (below) together with all necessary supporting documentation and the appropriate fee to: The Planning Department, Waterford City & County Council, Menapia Building, The Mall, Waterford. It is also possible to apply online.Online Planning ApplicationsIt is now possible to make a planning application online. You must first register on the ePlanning Portal.Existing Planning Applications are viewable by Map or Text on our Planning Enquiries page.Exempted developments 
Exempted developments do not require planning permission.  Categories of exempted development are set out on this page and in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2010. They refer to developments of a minor nature, such as small extensions to houses and so on. It is your resonsibility to ensure that any existing or planned development falls within the exemption thresholds (size, height, etc). If the particular development exceeds the thresholds listed, the development requires planning permission.Establishing a Requirement for Planning Permission A formal declaration can be sought from Waterford City & County Council to establish if full planning permission is required for a specific development proposal under Section 5 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 (as amended).  A completed application form accompanied by a Site Location Map, a fee of €80.00, and as much detail as possible outlining your proposal (drawings and photos etc.) should be submitted to the above address.  A decision will generally be issued within four weeks.  If the Planning Authority fails to issue a declaration within 4 weeks or the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the Planning Authority, the applicant may refer the matter to An Bord PleanÁla.



To put simply, Active Travel is making a journey by Walking, Cycling or  similar sustainable modes (think skateboards, roller skates, non-motorised  scooters). These journeys are usually short like walking to the shop or school  and cycling to work.

It can be a hard task to leave our cars at home, but we can try to make  small steps to change our habits. Next time you need a loaf of bread why not  walk to the shop. Maybe dedicate one or two days a week where you walk or cycle  to school with your children. If you do have to use your car, try to “Active  Travel” for part of the journey.

Travel Smarter â Not HarderOur planet is under severe stress due to Climate Change and we can all  play a part in making a change for the better. Active Travel is a great way to  start. 

Our roads and streets were originally designed and built for people.  Over time we changed our thought process and designed for cars. Now our road  networks cannot handle the volume of traffic. Even with more efficient cars we  still cause a huge environmental impact through congestion and pollution.But Active Travel is not just of benefit to our planet, it has a big effect  on our people.Physical & Mental  Health improvements â Active Travel has  clear benefits for us in terms of our physical health but also can improve our  mental health. Spending that little bit more time outdoors can really keep us  grounded. 

Quicker Journeys â You’re not going to get from one end of the  country to the other in a faster time than a car, but you might just get to  work a bit quicker on a bike. Remember, short journeys are where you will see  the big advantage.

Reduce Carbon  Emissions â This is a big one  if we are to save our planet from the effects of Climate Change. By reducing our car journeys, we can reduce pollution and make our public realms cleaner and healthier places to use.

Save Money â Walking is free! You can also make significant savings by using your bike instead of using expensive fuel in your car. The Bike to work scheme also provides tax relief for people who cycle to  work. 

Safer Routes to Schools â By encouraging our children to walk or cycle to school we can make a big impact on their safety  and wellbeing. Congestion at the school gates is often a major issue but Active Travel can help to create safer access options.

Reduce Traffic Congestion â By leaving our cars at home we will greatly reduce congestion on our roads. We also create easier access to local shops and amenities to enjoy.Â  

More Social Interaction â We tend to neglect our social health when we are isolated in our cars. Active Travel encourages more social interaction because we see more of each other on our journeys. TheÂ Active Travel programme will pursue the development and delivery ofÂ high-quality walking and cycling facilitiesÂ for use by people of all age groups inÂ ourÂ every-day travel.

The programme willÂ proactively engage with the public,Â localÂ interest groups,Â public service providers and public representatives to identify opportunities, developed ideas, deliver schemes andÂ promote andÂ encourageÂ the use of these facilitiesÂ in our day-to-day lives.Â The schemes delivered will aim to strengthen connections in communities, energise our public spacesÂ and makeÂ walking and cycling attractive,Â safe and accessible to everyone.Â 

The Active TravelÂ programmeÂ willÂ seek toÂ contribute to tackling climate changeÂ byÂ providingÂ the opportunity to useÂ “green”Â andÂ sustainable transport optionsÂ and integrate scheme designs with new and existingÂ public transport systems.Â Your community group can stay in touch with Active Travel proposals in your area.Register your group with the Public Participation Network.

Waterford City & County Council : Cycling stashed
In 2012 the Office of Public Works (OPW) commenced an extensive study of flood risk areas in conjunction with local authorities.Â Â  It identified 300 communities most likely to be impacted from future flooding, including 90 coastal communities.Â Â  Nationally, the CFRAM Progamme studied 80% of our  primary cause of flooding in communities that house almost two thirds of our population.Â Â  While the Programme assessed flood risk in all our major cities, approximately half of the communities assessed had populations of less than 2,000 people and one quarter had populations of less than 500 people.The CFRAM Programme is now providing us with the evidence to plan nationally to address flood risk, including more evidence to inform planning and development decisions and  emergency response planning.  The Commissioners of Public Works formally adopted the Flood Risk Management Plans on 14th March 2018.Â Â  These Plans were approved by Mr. Paschal Donohue TD, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 16th April, 2018.Â The CFRAM was a national study, the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken and followed best  practice.Â Â The Flood Risk Management Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway and provide the outline of 118 new proposed schemes.Â Â Together these schemes can  protect 95% of properties assessed to be at risk.Â Â The Flood Risk Management Plans provide the evidence to inform how future Government investment can return greatest benefit  nationally.On 3rd May the Minister of State for the OPW and Flood Relief announced he was making €14m available to the  local authority sector to lead on progressing 31 of these 118 schemes to detailed design.Â  Nationally there are 29 Flood Risk Management Plans which are developed across 6 River Basin  Districts and provide for the development of these 118 flood relief schemes.Â Â There are 4 schemes proposed for Waterford, which are for Aglish, Ballyduff, Dungarvan and Environs and Ringphuca.Â Â Â  An initial allocation of €257 million was announced for 50 of the 118 schemes to proceed to detailed design and construction stage, including two schemes in Waterford - Ballyduff and Aglish.All of these schemes will be managed by Waterford City and County Council, involving finalising designs and flood protection measures, further public consultation, completing the Part 8 Process, appointment of contractor and proceeding to construction.  The Flood Risk Management Plans for Aglish, Ballyduff, Dungarvan and Environs and Ringphuca were formally adopted by the Plenary Council at their meeting on 12th July, 2018.


The Roads and Transportation Department is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the existing public road network.  The network also consists of carriageways, margins, footpaths and kerbs.The department is also responsible for traffic and parking, public lighting and school wardens.The department's headquarters are based in the Civic Offices, Dungarvan with the District Engineers offices for the Dungarvan/Lismore and the Comeragh Municipal Districts also based there.The District Engineers office for the Metropolitan area of Waterford is based in the Menapia Building, The Mall, Waterford City. This office also handles all queries relating to traffic and parking for Waterford City, Dungarvan and Tramore. Public Lighting SpecificationWaterford City and County Council have prepared a public lighting specification as a means of ensuring that all public lighting projects meets relevant design and installation standards.

Six bathing waters in county Waterford are formally designated as bathing areas under national legislation. These are the major bathing areas of Ardmore, Bunmahon, Clonea, Dunmore Councillors’ Strand, Dunmore Main strand and Tramore. This designation means that they each have detailed management plans called âBathing Water Profiles’ which includes assessment and management of all potential pressures on bathing water quality from the catchment area. Designated bathing waters are also formally monitored and classified based on results of water quality monitoring.In addition to the six designated bathing waters, twelve âmedium size’ bathing areas (Woodstown, Guillamene, Newtown Cove, Ballyquin, Curragh, Goat Island, Annestown, Ballyvooney, Boatstrand, Kilfarrassey, Whiting Bay, and Stradbally Cove) and eleven âsmall size’ areas (Abbeyside, Baile na nGall, Ballydowane, Ballinacourty, Ballyvoyle, Garrarus, Cuan Heilbhic, Kilmurrin Cove, Owenashad River, Seapark and Tramore Pier) are also included in the council’s monitoring programme. The major bathing areas are tested every 2 weeks, the medium every 4 weeks and the small at least once during the season, which runs from June 1st to September 15th. Members of the public should note that inclusion of an area for testing or the provision of life saving equipment does not automatically infer that bathing is recommended by Waterford City & County Council.Waterford City & County Council annually reviews the list of designated bathing areas, focusing mainly on usage by the public, and we encourage public participation in the identification process in relation to the establishment, review and updating of designated bathing waters.

A total of 30 bathing areas are monitored during the bathing season. Bathing waters are monitored in respect of the bacterial indicators intestinal enterococci and E coli and inspections are carried out for other pollution such as tarry residues, glass, plastic, rubber or any other waste. Testing of bathing waters is conducted, on behalf of Waterford City & County Council, by the Environmental Health section of the Health Service Executive.Testing frequencies are tailored to the size and usage of each beach as outlined above.If a situation arises that could be expected to have an adverse impact on bathing water quality and the health of bathers, then the Council will ensure that timely and adequate measures, including the provision of information to the public are taken, including, if necessary, prohibition of or advice against bathing.

In order to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, a grant scheme to assist low-income households with the cost of replacing lead pipes and fittings within their properties is now available.Households with incomes between 50,001 euro and 75,000 euro will be eligible for a grant of 50% of approved costs with a maximum grant payable of 2,500 euro.A grant will only be paid after the works have been carried out and on production of a receipt Applicants must provide evidence of household income â these requirements mirror the conditions for the septic tank and social housing grants which are also administered by the local authorities Contractors engaged by householders must provide a copy of a current tax clearance certificate and certify that the works carried out and the materials and fittings used are of appropriate quality and standard.

Households that are not served by public sewers usually depend on wastewater treatment systems, either proprietary systems or septic tanks, to treat and dispose of wastewater. A well designed, installed, and maintained wastewater treatment system can provide years of reliable low-cost service.When systems fail to operate effectively, property damage, ground and surface water pollution, and disease outbreaks can occur. Therefore, it makes good sense to understand and care for your wastewater treatment system.What is a Wastewater Treatment System?   

A wastewater treatment system is a piece of infrastructure into which the raw sewage from the house enters and is partially treated. The partially treated effluent is then discharged to a percolation area for final treatment and eventual disposal to ground.Wastewater treatment systems come in various shapes and sizes and are normally located in your garden. Wastewater treatment systems accept all waste water from your house, which includes toilet, shower, sink, kitchen and washing machine wastewater. A percolation area typically consists of a system of sub-surface perforated pipes, which allows the liquid to drain into the surrounding soil.

How does a Wastewater Treatment System work?  

A wastewater treatment works like a simple sewage treatment works and the partially treated effluent drains from the tank’s outlet pipe via a distribution box to the percolation area.
The wastewater is collected in the tank. Heavier solid material entering the tank will sink to the bottom. This is called sludge. The materials that remain near the top of the tank (oil, fat, and grease) are called scum.
Naturally occurring bacteria which are present in the sewage are encouraged to breed within the tank and digest the solids. Over time, partially decomposed solids build up on the bottom of the tank. This sludge has to be removed regularly to ensure that the system continues to work properly and to prevent the percolation area becoming blocked. 
After the partially treated wastewater leaves the tank it flows into the percolation area trenches. In the percolation area, holes at the bottom of each distribution pipe allow the wastewater to drain into gravel trenches for temporary storage. 
The soil below the percolation area provides the final treatment and disposal of the wastewater treatment effluent. As the effluent passes into the soil, most of it percolates downwards and outwards. The soil then filters the effluent as it passes through the pore spaces.
How can I tell if my Wastewater Treatment System is developing problems? 
Warning lights are flashing;
Sewage surfacing over percolation area;
Sewage back-ups in the house;
Slow draining toilets or drains;
Sewage odours;
Lush, green growth over the percolation area;
These problems tend to arise due to blocked pipes or excessive build up of solids in the tank. You may be able to clear pipe blockages by using drain rods but in some cases you may need to call a qualified plumber. The tank may also require emptying.
How do I care for my Wastewater treatment System? 
Keep records of when it was last cleaned and inspected by the manufacturer.
Do monthly inspections of the area around the tank. Prevention is always better than cure, as, once damage is caused to the drainage system, replacement is often the only option. In the long term it pays to be vigilant.

What are the DOs and DON'Ts for my Wastewater Treatment System? 
DOs
DO: divert other sources of water, like roof drains away from the wastewater treatment system. Excessive water upsets the system.
DO: set up maintenance contracts with the suppliers of the system.
DO: desludge the tank as often as is necessary.
DO: act immediately if there is a sign of any blockage or any sign of pollution.

DON'Ts
DON’T: use bleaches and disinfectant, or use sparingly, as they could kill the bacteria that help to digest the waste.
DON’T: use your toilet as a rubbish bin, or poison your system by pouring harmful chemicals, cleansers, oil or grease down the drain.
DON’T: flush rags, disposable nappies, kitchen towels, wipes, sanitary items or cotton buds down the toilet.
DON’T: enter a wastewater treatment plant. Toxic gases are produced by the natural treatment processes and can kill in minutes.
DON’T: allow anyone to drive or park over any part of the system.
DON’T: plant anything over or near the percolation area except grass. Roots from nearby trees and shrubs may clog and damage the drain lines.
DON’T: wash paint brushes in the sink or put brush cleaning liquids into the drains leading to the wastewater treatment system. Please dispose of these in an environmentally- friendly way.
DON’T: use caustic solutions to open blocked drains â use drain rods instead

How often should I have the Wastewater Treatment System cleared?   

Wastewater treatment systems need periodic check-ups and proper care to remain healthy and function properly. It is recommended that a wastewater treatment should be emptied once a year; this period may be extended depending on the system’s size and usage. A check should be carried out regularly to see whether or not it needs desludging. The percolation area should also be checked for sogginess or flooding. If the system works well it will not smell.

Why should I maintain my Wastewater Treatment System?   

Failing wastewater treatment systems can:
Cause a serious health threat to your family and neighbours;
Pollute groundwater;
Be very expensive to repair;
Reduce the value of your property;
Put drinking water supplies at risk.
You are also responsible for ensuring that :

The wastewater treatment system is properly maintained and is emptied regularly;
The wastewater treatment system access lids are secure and in good working order; and
The drains to and from the wastewater treatment system, including the percolation area are free-flowing and free from blockages.
What should I look for when purchasing a new property?   
Before buying a home, check that the design capacity of the wastewater treatment system and percolation area will adequately serve the anticipated number of occupants of the house.
Ask if a maintenance log is kept. Check that the wastewater treatment system is in good structural order and has no history of problems. 
Ensure that the percolation area is inspected for evidence of flooding. Your Building Society or Bank valuation is unlikely to cover these aspects adequately and a competent surveyor should carry out all these checks and inspections.

How does a Wastewater Treatment System work?  

A wastewater treatment works like a simple sewage treatment works and the partially treated effluent drains from the tank’s outlet pipe via a distribution box to the percolation area.The wastewater is collected in the tank. Heavier solid material entering the tank will sink to the bottom. This is called sludge. The materials that remain near the top of the tank (oil, fat, and grease) are called scum.Naturally occurring bacteria which are present in the sewage are encouraged to breed within the tank and digest the solids. Over time, partially decomposed solids build up on the bottom of the tank. This sludge has to be removed regularly to ensure that the system continues to work properly and to prevent the percolation area becoming blocked. 
After the partially treated wastewater leaves the tank it flows into the percolation area trenches. In the percolation area, holes at the bottom of each distribution pipe allow the wastewater to drain into gravel trenches for temporary storage. The soil below the percolation area provides the final treatment and disposal of the wastewater treatment effluent. As the effluent passes into the soil, most of it percolates downwards and outwards. The soil then filters the effluent as it passes through the pore spaces.How can I tell if my Wastewater Treatment System is developing problems? 
Warning lights are flashing;
Sewage surfacing over percolation area;
Sewage back-ups in the house;
Slow draining toilets or drains;
Sewage odours;
Lush, green growth over the percolation area;
These problems tend to arise due to blocked pipes or excessive build up of solids in the tank. You may be able to clear pipe blockages by using drain rods but in some cases you may need to call a qualified plumber. The tank may also require emptying.
How do I care for my Wastewater treatment System? 
Keep records of when it was last cleaned and inspected by the manufacturer.
Do monthly inspections of the area around the tank. Prevention is always better than cure, as, once damage is caused to the drainage system, replacement is often the only option. In the long term it pays to be vigilant.

What are the DOs and DON'Ts for my Wastewater Treatment System? 
DOs
DO: divert other sources of water, like roof drains away from the wastewater treatment system. Excessive water upsets the system.
DO: set up maintenance contracts with the suppliers of the system.
DO: desludge the tank as often as is necessary.
DO: act immediately if there is a sign of any blockage or any sign of pollution.

DON'Ts
DON’T: use bleaches and disinfectant, or use sparingly, as they could kill the bacteria that help to digest the waste.
DON’T: use your toilet as a rubbish bin, or poison your system by pouring harmful chemicals, cleansers, oil or grease down the drain.
DON’T: flush rags, disposable nappies, kitchen towels, wipes, sanitary items or cotton buds down the toilet.
DON’T: enter a wastewater treatment plant. Toxic gases are produced by the natural treatment processes and can kill in minutes.
DON’T: allow anyone to drive or park over any part of the system.
DON’T: plant anything over or near the percolation area except grass. Roots from nearby trees and shrubs may clog and damage the drain lines.
DON’T: wash paint brushes in the sink or put brush cleaning liquids into the drains leading to the wastewater treatment system. Please dispose of these in an environmentally- friendly way.
DON’T: use caustic solutions to open blocked drains â use drain rods instead

How often should I have the Wastewater Treatment System cleared?   

Wastewater treatment systems need periodic check-ups and proper care to remain healthy and function properly. It is recommended that a wastewater treatment should be emptied once a year; this period may be extended depending on the system’s size and usage. A check should be carried out regularly to see whether or not it needs desludging. The percolation area should also be checked for sogginess or flooding. If the system works well it will not smell.

Why should I maintain my Wastewater Treatment System?   

Failing wastewater treatment systems can:
Cause a serious health threat to your family and neighbours;
Pollute groundwater;
Be very expensive to repair;
Reduce the value of your property;
Put drinking water supplies at risk.
You are also responsible for ensuring that :

The wastewater treatment system is properly maintained and is emptied regularly;
The wastewater treatment system access lids are secure and in good working order; and
The drains to and from the wastewater treatment system, including the percolation area are free-flowing and free from blockages.
What should I look for when purchasing a new property?   
Before buying a home, check that the design capacity of the wastewater treatment system and percolation area will adequately serve the anticipated number of occupants of the house.
Ask if a maintenance log is kept. Check that the wastewater treatment system is in good structural order and has no history of problems. 
Ensure that the percolation area is inspected for evidence of flooding. Your Building Society or Bank valuation is unlikely to cover these aspects adequately and a competent surveyor should carry out all these checks and inspections.

East Waterford Water Supply Scheme is the primary water supply in Co. Waterford. It supplies potable water to Waterford City and the eastern parts of the county including Tramore and Dunmore East.The East Waterford Water Supply Scheme (EWWSS) was originally constructed and commissioned in 1984 to provide 25,000m approx. of potable water on a daily basis. Since then, steady population growth and increases in commercial/industrial development and tourism in the eastern region of County Waterford has demanded a significant increase in the capacity of the potable water supply facilities for the region. Waterford County Council appointed MC O’Sullivan Consulting Engineers (now RPS Consulting Engineers) to initially examine and report on the feasibility of expanding the overall capacity of the EWWSS, while conforming with the various Environmental Legislation, Directives and Regulations governing the sourcing, treatment and supply of drinking water in Ireland.Design proposals were approved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlining an expanded raw water intake and supply network, together with an expanded treatment plant at Adamstown and distribution pipelines capable of meeting population demands for the foreseeable future.West Waterford Regional Supply Scheme The West Waterford Area includes almost half of the county. There are over 50 separate Water Supply Schemes currently serving the area, many of which are experiencing supply shortages or water quality problems. The lack of an adequate water supply is a major constraint on the sustainable development of the area. For these reasons, Waterford City & County Council wish to rationalise the existing supply arrangements and develop a new Water Supply for the West Waterford Area.The Councils Assessment of Needs, 2007 â 2016, states:The Department of the Environment have included €2.945m for West Waterford Water Supply Scheme in its 2007 â 2009 Water Services Investment Programme as a Scheme to start in 2008.
