Waterford City & County Council,images/dungarvan-maps.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Archives : Collections,"In 1832 the Boundary Commission produced a report and map on the boundaries of Dungarvan Town

More detailed maps of the town were produced as part of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in 1842. These maps are now available online from the Ordinance Survey of Ireland       

In January 1901 the first in a series of detailed maps of Dungarvan Town were produced as part of a drainage scheme for Dungarvan.These maps are a great resource for Dungarvan and show many of the buidings and amenities of Dungarvan at the time. Please note these are large scale maps and may be slow to download.

Dungarvan SS First Sketch 1901   The maps were largely the work of Michael Beary, Dungarvan Borough Surveyor and show a vibrant Dungarvan town with exciting local amenities such as Turkish Baths, public parks and public bathing facilities. However, the maps were produced in response to a report by Dr. Brown, Medical Inspector, Local Government Board made 18th July 1899. His report highlighed the poor drainage in the town which he held directly responsible for a recent case of enteric fever and an outbreak of typhus in October 1898. Dungarvan Urban District Council held a Special Meeting on 17th November 1899 to consider his report and those of the Medical Officer of Health, Sanitary Officer and the Borough Surveyor. Michael Beary, Borough Surveyor, presented a report on a new Dungarvan Main Drainage Scheme that was unanimously passed by the members who directed the Executive Sanitary Officer to seek a loan from the Local Government Board to execute this proposal. A loan was duly procured and Michael Beary produced his detailed plans for the new drainage scheme. Dungarvan Town, 1901  Dungarvan Drainage, 1901
  
  This colour map produced by Michael Beary shows Dungarvan in great detail with many of the buildings in the town identified with the town's amenities also on show. Among the amenities in Dungarvan were Turkish Baths conveniently located opposite Dungarvan Castle and Infantry Barracks.
  
  Turkish Baths  Turkish Baths, 1901   
  
  At the time the Drainage Scheme was being developed the Park and Ladies and Men's Bathing places were being re-developed courtesy of a bequest made by Captain Gibbons. The park was developed and new bathing boxes were procured and the concrete repaired at the bathing places. Cocoa matting was supplied for the spring board at the bathing place.

  In addition to showing details of Dungarvan town the maps also show the details and depths of Dungarvan Harbour.

  The scheme extended to Abbeyside and Dungarvan wards in 1911.  Dungarvan Main Drainage, 1911
  
  Michael Beary was very passionately involved in the design and building of the Dungarvan Drainage Scheme and continued his involvement after he left his position as Borough Surveyor.

  These maps present a flavour of the series of maps for Dungarvan and further maps are available at the County Archive. The maps show the lines of the pipes but also indicate the lands acquired for the scheme and identify the owners of these lands. Among the detailed sketches of the pipelines are further features from Dungaran town of the time, including this detailed sketch of a lamp-post in the town.

As  part of Budget 2024, the Government signed off on a package of Ã¢ ‚ ¬257m for the  Increased Cost of Business (ICOB) Grant as a vital measure for small and medium  businesses. Waterford City and County Council, funded through Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE), will manage the rollout of the grant  to qualifying businesses.  
Eligible  businesses will receive a once-off grant payment. The amount of the grant  payable to eligible businesses is based on the value of the Commercial Rates  bill the business received in 2023. However, it is not a Commercial Rates  waiver and businesses should continue to pay their Commercial Rates bill as  normal.

What is the purpose of the grant?
The  grant is available to qualifying businesses as a contribution towards the rising  costs faced by businesses. The grant is intended to aid businesses but is not  intended to directly compensate for all increases in wages, or other costs, for  every business.

How much is the grant?
The grant is based on the  value of the Commercial Rates bill received by an eligible business in 2023.
What businesses  are eligible to receive the grant?
The following are the main  qualifying criteria:Please  note that Waterford City and County  Council reserves the right to claw back any grant payment which is later found  to be incorrect. This includes any circumstances such as error by the recipient business or the local authority  making the payment, or where a business makes a false declaration of  eligibility. 

How soon can  businesses avail of the grant?
An  online system is being developed to manage the submission of essential  information. Waterford City and County  Council will write  shortly to businesses with further details, including how to register and how  to submit information online. The system is expected to be available in  mid-March.

What is the closing date?
The closing date for businesses to confirm eligibility  and to upload verification details will be 1st May 2024.

Where can I find out further information?
Further correspondence and  guidance will be issued to commercially rateable businesses in the next few  weeks. In addition, an FAQ will be available online when the grant scheme  opens. You should refer to this guidance and FAQ prior to making your  submission.
If you have queries regarding  your Commercial Rates account including outstanding balances, contact Waterford  City and County Council at rates@waterfordcouncil.ie. Our team are happy to discuss any balances  outstanding on your rates and what steps can be taken to ensure compliance with  the scheme.The Community Climate Action Programme is a new programme to support small and large, rural and urban communities to take climate action at a local level.

  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 contains a statutory provision for the preparation of a six year Local Economic & Community Plan (LECP) which was adopted by Waterford City & County Council at their meeting on 14th December 2023. The purpose of the LECP is to set out the objectives and actions needed to promote and support the economic development and the local and community development of Waterford (the local authority area).

This LECP provides a roadmap for how Government, Waterford City and County Council, development agencies and others will work together to improve the lives of all living and working throughout the City and County.  The LECP identifies the high-level goals, objectives, and actions and enablers needed to develop and sustain a vibrant economy and society in the period from 2023-2029.

The development of a digital strategy for Waterford commenced back in early 2018 when a steering group was formed. The four main themes of the digital strategy; are:

Digital Infrastructure
Citizen/Community
Digital Economy
Digital Council


The working group is charged with developing objectives and actions for the Digital Strategy Implementation Plan under each theme and contributing to the Digital Strategy Report. Waterford's Broadband Officer is coordinating the digital strategy through the working group and the Department of Communications (DCCAE), the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) and their appointed consultants to deliver our local digital strategy.

A digital readiness assessment was completed in 2018, followed by training at national digital strategy workshops which led to the creation of guidelines for development of local digital strategies. These guidelines are helping to progress to report completion by laying out a strategy roadmap.

Waterford City & County Council has prepared a Digital Strategy to set the framework of support for communities and businesses to reap the full rewards of a digitally enabled society.	
 As part of the process, a period of public consultation ran in 2021, with an issues paper thereafter developed with feedback from the consultation and stakeholder engagement. It presented an overview of the strategy framework, set out questions and encouraged discussion that was considered in the Strategy creation. 
Local input was vital to the entire Digital Strategy process with the Issues Paper  stimulating interest and  debate resulting in constructive, positive and helpful feedback.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/archives/collections/dungarvan.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Archives : Collections,"Dungarvan has a long history of local administration.An Act of Parliament held under Edward IV in 1463 at Wexford refers to 'The Portreeve and Commons of the Town of Dungarvan'. On 4 January 1609/1610 James I granted a charter to Dungarvan stating that there should be a corporate body within the borough consisting of a Sovereign, Brethren and Free Burgesses. However, by the end of the seventeenth century it appears that the corporation ceased to function in Dungarvan.Local government in Dungarvan was reintroduced when a town meeting was held in order to adopt the Town's Improvement Act 1854. The first election of the new Town Commissioners was held in the Magistrate's room in the Courthouse on 29th January 1855.On 8th June 1863 the Dungarvan Harbour, Markets and Improvement Act 1863 was passed. This act enabled the Dungarvan Town Commissioners to extend and regulate the markets of Dungarvan and allowed for the transfer of the management of the roads and bridges in the town from the Waterford Grand Jury to the Dungarvan Town Commissioners. The Act allowed the Commissioners to hold property and lands, to act as a Harbour Authority and collect Harbour dues. It also allowed the Commissioners to collect rates, borrow money and have control of the markets and roads within the town.Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 local government in Ireland was reorganised and Dungarvan became an urban district. Local elections were held and new Urban District Councillors were elected. On 23rd January 1899, the first meeting of the Dungarvan Urban District Council was held.The Minute Books for the period 1855-1900 detail the work of the Town Commissioners, recording the improvements on the town of Dungarvan, the work of the Commissioners as a harbour authority and the functions of the Town Commissioners as a sanitary authority under the Public Health Act, 1875. The Commissioners dealt with and oversaw the maintenance of the roads, harbour, markets, waterworks and provided artisan's dwellings under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.Following the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 the Minute Books detail the work of Dungarvan Urban District Council. It is of interest to note that the same Minute Book (UDC/1/8) was used to record the last meetings of the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and with the turn of a page was used to record the first meetings of the Dungarvan Urban District Council.The Minutes for the meetings of Dungarvan Urban District Council record the elections of councillors, the striking of rates, the provision of housing and sanitary services for Dungarvan, the maintenance and improvement of the harbour and town and the resolutions of the urban district councillors. Click here for a sample of Minutes.The Minutes of the Meetings of Dungarvan Town Commissioners and Dungarvan Urban District Council are an invaluable record for the town of Dungarvan. The developments of the town can be traced under both administrations and the growth of the town is clearly recorded. Events of local, national and international significance are also recorded.  The heroic sea rescues and tragic losses at sea are recorded within the pages of the Minute Books. The presence of Belgian refugees in Dungarvan during the First World War was recorded in the minutes (UDC/1/11) and a concert in aid of the Belgians was held in the Town Hall in Dungarvan on Monday 7th December 1914.The allegiance of the Urban District Council to Dáil Éireann was recorded in the Minutes of the Dungarvan Urban District Council. The arrest of Patrick Whelan, urban district councillor, by the British authorities was recorded (UDC/1/12). The Urban District Council (UDC/1/18) supported the stance of Eamonn de Valera in maintaining the neutrality of Ireland during the Second World War. The visit of the mayor of Chicago to Dungarvan in 1964 is recorded in the minutes (UDC/1/19).  The Minute Books of the Town Commissioners and Urban District Council were maintained by the Urban District Council in the Town Hall, Friary Street until the Urban District Council moved to new premises in the Civic Offices, Dungarvan. At this time the Minute Books and other records were boxed and transferred to the Waterford County Archive Service.Little beyond the Minute Books survive for the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and the records of the Town Commissioners and the earlier Corporation may have been lost when the old Market House in Lower Main Street was sold by the Duke of Devonshire in 1861. Records relating to Dungarvan Corporation may be found among the Lismore and Chatsworth papers due to the close association between the Corporation and the Dukes of Devonshire.Further records in relation to the Dungarvan Town Commissioners and the early days of the Dungarvan Urban District Council were destroyed in the 1950s during an over enthusiastic cleaning of the Town Hall in Friary Street.However, there are a number of early files and maps among the records retained in the Town Hall, which were then transferred to Waterford County Archive Service. In 1990 Dungarvan Museum came into the possession of the papers of John Hunt of Bayview House, Ballinacourty, Dungarvan who had been solicitor for the local authority in Dungarvan from c. 1870 - c. 1920 and these are available to researchers at Waterford County Museum, Old Town Hall in Friary Street, Dungarvan. You may also want to check out the award-winning Waterford County Museum website.

Click here for the Library Catalogue.This calendar is invaluable as it contains a detailed account of the minutes allowing for a quick search for information. It also contains the only record of a volume UDC/1/6 for the period 16 April 1883-27 June 1888 which was not found among the material boxed and transferred to the Archive Store from the old Town Hall.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/archives/collections/grand-jury.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Grand Jury Collection,"Waterford County was established by the writ of John, King of England and Wales and Lord of Ireland in the thirteenth century. In the medieval period a Sheriff, appointed by royal authority, administered the county. The Sheriff was responsible for the collection of taxes, repair of castles, gaols, arrangements for court sessions, the policing of the county, the election of a Coroner and the construction of roads and other public works. The King's Judges visited twice yearly to hold Assizes with the assistance of the Grand Jury. The members of the Grand Jury were chosen by the Sheriff from among the largest landowners in the county.From the seventeenth century the Grand Jury began to acquire functions beyond the administration of justice and became involved in the provision of roads and bridges and the collection of county cess, the tax levied to pay for these works.  A limited franchise was also introduced and elections were carried out for membership of the Grand Jury. Details of the franchise legislation can be found in the collection. (GJ/30) 
Gradually they accumulated further functions.By the beginning of the nineteenth century they were responsible for a wide range of works and services including roads and bridges, lunatic asylums, county infirmaries and fever hospitals, dispensaries, courthouses and gaols. It is this period, the nineteenth century, which the collection details.
The Query Books (GJ/1-8) provide information regarding the maintenance of roads and bridges and of works such as the construction of piers and the development of the railway in Waterford County.
The Contract Books (GJ/15-18) and the Assize Presentment Books (GJ/9-14) detail the contracts for the building of roads and the other construction work undertaken in the county.
The Account Books (GJ/21-23) provide evidence of the county cess paid by individuals and the manner in which these funds were expended.
Click here to see the Grand Jury Descriptive lists.
The administrative powers and duties of the grand juries were transferred to County Councils and Rural District Councils by the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.The archives of the grand jury are a valuable resource as they provide evidence of the beginning of the county infrastructure, as we know it today. Many of the roads, bridges and piers still in use today were originally built under the aegis of the grand jury. These records also provide evidence of the building of railway lines in the county, many of which are no longer in use or existence. The accounts of the grand jury (GJ/21-25) also contain a glimpse at the social conditions of the time with entries such as payments made for the maintenance and transport of prisoners.Due to the small size of the collection, little arrangement has been carried out. It has simply been arranged with the 'Query Books' and 'Contract Books' followed by the 'Account Books' in order to show, first, the work carried out by the grand jury and then the cost of carrying out these works and services.Similar records can be found among the archives of other County Councils in Ireland.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/archives/collections/private-papers.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Private Papers,"The City and County Archive holds some private paper collections. These include the Chearnley Papers, which date from 1671 to 1915 and relate to the Musgrave and Chearnley families living in Salterbridge, barony of Coshmore and Coshbride, County Waterford.The archive also holds the papers of Hugh Ryan a local historian and scholar. The collection includes political pamphlets relating to Irish nationalism from 1900-1960 and records relating to a survey of the gravestones of Mothel burial ground, parish of Mothel and Rathgormack carried out by Hugh Ryan and published in Decies volumes 38-42. The collections also include the papers of Waterford Chamber of Commerce and archives in relation to Thomas Francis Meagher.Further collections of estate records, business records and private records relating to Waterford City and County will be made available to the public as the City and County Archive develops and expands its collections.The City and County Archive also provides advice and guidance to organisations and individuals who hold archival collections in Waterford City and County.Cappoquin House and Gardens holds a collection of archives and is working to preserve these archives and make them accessible.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/archives/collections/workhouses.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Workhouses / Board of Guardians Collection,"The Boards of Guardians were established under the Poor Law Act, 1838.  This Act divided the country into a number of Poor Law Unions each of which had a Board of Guardians and a Workhouse. County Waterford had four poor law unions: Dungarvan, Kilmacthomas, Lismore and Waterford City. The members of the Board of Guardians were local landowners. The Boards of Guardians were given the responsibility for the ""social welfare"" and public health of the people within the poor law union.The City and County Archive holds the minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Guardians. At the beginning of the meetings held each week statistics are filled in detailing the number and categories of people admitted and dying in the Workhouse. This is naturally of interest in determining the effect of the Famine in the local area. The minutes also provide information on the food consumed in the Workhouse and the manner in which the ""inmates"" spent their days. The minutes also provide information on outbreaks of disease in the area and events affecting the area. The Registers for the workhouses do not survive or have not been found to date, so there is no record of the admittances to each of the Workhouses.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/archives/exhibitions/waterford-ww1/index.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Waterford in World War 1,"Introduction
   
      
  
The causes of the First World War are many and complex. In the years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War tensions were high across Europe as countires struggled for security and power. A series of alliances were struck between countries that resulted in the spread of war across Europe and far beyond in 1914. The spark that ignited the outbreak of the First World War was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungarian throne, on 28 June 1914. It was the belief of Austria-Hungary that the Serbian government were connected to those who carried out the assassination that lead them to declare war on Serbia on 31st July 1914. This, in turn, caused Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in support of their allies, Serbia. It was this system of alliances that pulled France, Germany and Britain into the war as well. Germany in support of its allies Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia on the 1st August and on France on the 3rd of August 1914.Britain joined the war in support of its ally Belgium. In the Treaty of London 1839 Britain committed to defend Belgium and when Germany invaded Belgium in order to counter any possible movement by France, Britain called for Germany to leave Belgium. On 4th August 1914 Britain declared war on Germany following its failure to retreat from Belgium. Ireland was still part of Britain in 1914 and as a result Ireland was at war.In 1914 the focus of Ireland was on the goal of Home Rule. John Redmond, MP for Waterford between 1891 and 1918 was the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. He had successfully manoeuvered to bring the Home Rule Bill, 1914 through the House of Commons and through the House of Lords, where the six counties of Northern Ireland were to be temporarily removed from the provisions of the Act, against the wishes of Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party. Despite the abstention of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Lords, the Bill was passed and Home Rule was due to be signed into law with royal assent in September 1914 when the outbreak of the First World War intervened and postponed the enactment of Home Rule for Ireland. John Redmond called on the Irish Volunteers to support the Allies and Britain in the war effort and to join the British Army to fight.Many in Waterford responded to this call to serve and left Waterford City and County to fight and die on the battle fields of the First World War. Information on those who gave their lives can be found on the database of the Waterford War Dead. To find out more about those who served during the First World War take look through the Permanent Digital Memorial Lives of the First World War. This digital memorial provides people with the opportunity to find out more about those who served in the First World War and also to add any information they have to that memorial.The following exhibition from the archives held in Waterford City and County provides a glimpse into aspects of the First World War and life in Waterford from 1914-1918.

The records in the City and County Archive can be consulted for private study or research but copyright permission must be sought if you intend to reproduce or publish any of the archives in the City and County Archive. In the case of the local authority records in the City and County Archive you can apply to the Archivist for permission to publish.   The City and County Archive may not hold copyright ownership on private collections and you are responsible for gaining copyright permission to reproduce or publish from these collections and for any failure to comply with copyright legislation. A copy of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 can be found here.

Accessing Personal Information  

Waterford City and County Archives Service holds collections of records that sometimes contain personal information about individuals and it is the policy of Waterford City and County Archive Service not to release any personal information until 100 years old. This is in compliance with the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the Data Protection (Amendment) Act, 2003.

It can be tempting to assume that when a record is closed to access there are deep, dark secrets being hidden but personal information can simply refer to the name and address of a person.

The goal of the Archive Services is to provide access to information and in the case of personal information it is still possible to access these records provided you are the person to whom they relate or that you have the permission of the person to whom they relate. If the person to whom the records relate is deceased then you must provide evidence in the form of their Death Certificate to gain access to the records. If you are researching your family history and you would like to access records you believe relate to your family then you must provide the evidence of your research showing your connection to the person/s in the records.

The Archive Service will facilitate researchers in as far as possible to help identify if the records relate to their family but cannot provide access to personal information without certainty that the records are definitely relating to the family in question. In cases where this is uncertain the records will not be accessible.

If you have any queries about accessing personal information or any of the collections in the Archives please contact the Archivist at archivist@waterfordcouncil.ieCollecting Policy of Waterford City and County Archive  
    The City and County Archive works to preserve collections of archives relating to the history and development of Waterford City and County. The records are stored in environmentally controlled conditions and care is taken to ensure they are stored and handled in a manner that ensures their long-term preservation. The goal of the City and County Archive is not only to ensure the preservation of its records but also to make these records available to researchers in Waterford and beyond. 

In general, it is the policy of the City and County Archive to collect related groups of records rather than individual items, as this ensures that the records can provide a more complete and accurate picture of an organisation, business, family estate or institution. Also, the research value of the records may be diminished if they are removed from their original source.  If you have a collection of material that you feel is of historic interest in relation to the City and County of Waterford, then please contact the Archivist.

Current: records are stored within the offices and are frequently required by staff in order to carry out the functions of their section.
 Non-current: records become non-current when they are needed for only occasional reference or in order to meet legal or financial obligations. When records are non-current they are taken out of the offices and stored in a Records Centre.
 Archive/Dispose: records that are no longer required by the local authority are destroyed or transferred to the Archive. Records Management Policy

ONLINE TALKS SERIES: Waterford in 1920
As part of its Decade  of Centenaries events Waterford City and County Council is delighted to make  available this series of talks exploring 1920 in Waterford and the voices that  were fighting to be heard in the creation of a new Ireland ... an independent Ireland.Waterford and the 1920 Local  Elections: Fighting for a Voice and a new Ireland1920 was a very turbulent year for local authorities in Ireland. It was an election year for  local government and newly elected councils, including Waterford Corporation  and Waterford County Council, immediately pledged their allegiance to Dáil  Éireann. This resulted in the withdrawal of funding by the British Local  Government Board; raids on local authorities and the arrest of elected members  and staff.  Local authorities struggled  to collect rates but continued to provide services as best they could and  maintained their commitment to Dáil Éireann. This network of local political and  administrative support was an important part of the success of Dáil Éireann and demonstrated the commitment of the Irish people to the goal of an independent  Ireland. At the same time local  government was pledging to Dáil Éireann a new courts system was established for the nascent state, operating under the radar and parallel to the official courts system and were soon leaving the officially sanctioned courts with no cases as the Irish people moved to have their voices heard and their legal cases handled in the Dáil Courts. 1920 also saw significant labour unrest and what has been referred to as a Waterford  €œsoviet € was fighting to have its voice heard. Cumann na mBan too were hard at work in  Waterford in 1920, supporting and serving the War of Independence and trying to make a place for women in the new Ireland they were struggling to create.  Our speakers will explore 1920 in Waterford looking at the issues of the time and exploring the voices seeking to be heard in the 1920 local elections.  Click on the link to watch each talk on You Tube.

There are however, many burial grounds for which no burial registers survive, many burial grounds that are closed, or some that are not in the ownership of the local parish. Local community groups and Solas (FÁS) have worked together to clean and record the information from headstones in a number of burial grounds throughout the City and County. The information from this work has been collated and is available in a searchable online database at Waterford City and County Library under the title ""Grave Inscriptions Database"".Other digitised resources
As 'Sanitary Authorities', the Board of Guardians in the Poor Law Unions, who ran local workhouses, also became responsible for the operation of some of the burial grounds in the City and County. The City Council also operated as Sanitary Authority, as were the Grand Jury and Dungarvan Town Commissioners. In the early twentieth century, the new County Council, Rural District Councils and Urban District Council established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, acting as Sanitary Authorities, opened new burial grounds or took over responsibility for some older grounds. These burial grounds became the responsibility of Waterford County Council or of the Town Councils when the Rural District Councils were abolished in 1925.Waterford City and County Archives has digitised the burial registers that survive from these authorities. The burial registers have been provided as PDF documents (there is not a search facility) but where there is an index in a register, this can be used to locate specific entries. Maps of each of the burial grounds have also been provided. You can click on each of the maps provided and enlarge them to enable individual plot numbers to be visible on the map.Thompson's Funeral Books

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/family-history/census-records.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Census Records," A census of population was taken every 10 years from 1821-1911. Unfortunately, due to the destruction of the Public Records Office in 1922 most of these censuses, up until the 1901 returns, were destroyed. Fragments of surviving, earlier census records as well as the 1901 and 1911 census records, are available online from the National Archives of Ireland. The records can be searched by the family name and by townland and the website provides detailed guidelines on how to search the census records.The Central Library and Dungarvan Library also hold microfilm copies of the 1901 and 1911 census records. When searching the census records remember to try different spellings of surnames e.g. Walsh, Welsh, Walch. In some cases the spelling may be quite different or the name was not transcribed correctly which can make the person difficult to locate by searching for the name. In these cases you can Browse the census forms online by location. In order to do this you will need to know the townland name and the Electoral Division. 
The details on the census forms can also be used to lead to the next research step. The ages given on the census forms are not always accurate but they do give a place to start when searching for birth records. The 1911 census asked how long a couple were married and subtracting this from 1911 provides the year of the marriage and can be used to track down the marriage certificate or marriage record in the parish records.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/family-history/emigration.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Archives : Family History,"Lismore Castle Estate Emigration Database
   
      This project received funding under the European Union INTERREG IIIA Ireland/Wales Community Initiative Programme.  As the name suggests, it was a three-way project between partners Dublin City Archives and Waterford County Archive (Ireland Strand) and Gwynedd County Archives (Wales Strand).  The Celtic TrÃƒ ­ Project aims to foster cultural connections between Ireland and Wales, exploring links between the two nations, through music, poetry, migration, sport and the spoken word, particularly the extent and use of the two Celtic languages. Family history was an important component of Celtic TrÃƒ ­, and all three archives services featured this in their scheduled projects, with funding being provided by INTERREG for the appointment of genealogists in each service on a contract basis. In addition, Waterford County Archive was awarded INTERREG funding for the creation of a database of records of genealogical interest and the production of a publication on genealogical sources in the County. 
      Lismore Estate Papers Emigration Record Database 1815-1905
   
      The Lismore Estate Emigration Record Database was created to facilitate the retrieval of information relating to emigration from Lismore Castle Estate during the period 1815-1905. The Lismore Estate refers to the estates of the Dukes of Devonshire and relates to lands largely situated in the counties of Waterford and Cork. Lismore Castle was and remains the seat of the Dukes of Devonshire in Ireland.Large families and few employment prospects ensured that a constant stream of applications were made to the agent of the Duke of Devonshire or in some cases to the Duke of Devonshire himself. These were recorded in Tenant Application Books or in the correspondence of the time. If assistance to emigrate was granted the payment was then recorded in the estate Account Books.The Lismore Estate Emigration Record Database is comprised of four searchable fields. The information contained in these fields is taken directly from the Tenant Application Books, from correspondence with the estate and from Account Books. Each record contains the applicant's name and address (where provided), the date of the application, the applicant's destination (where provided) and a transcript of the entry contained in each or all of the aforementioned estate records. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information supplied and in cases where it was not possible to decipher the word in the original records square brackets are given to show that the information is an educated guess rather than a certainty.Tenant Name : Data in this field is entered in the following manner: Surname [comma] Firstname 

The spelling of names has not been standardised. Therefore, when conducting a search it is essential that all spelling variations are entered. For example, if the surname O'Brien is the subject of a query, then the following variants should also be entered: Brien, Brian and Bryan. Note that prefixes, such as, O and Mac are used only sporadically in the records and therefore searches should be conducted both including and excluding them.
Townlands
   
      The spelling of placenames in this field has been standardised. The standard used is that determined by the Lismore Estate itself, where townlands are listed in formal indices. A supplemenatry list, which includes a list of those townlands whose spelling in the Lismore Estate indices differs significantly from the spellings included in the publications LiostaÃƒ ­ Logainmneacha Port Láirge (Dublin, 1991), The Place-Names of the Decies, Rev. P. Power (London, 1907) and Townlands in Poor Law Unions, George B. Handron (USA, 1997) is available here.
      Dates
   
      This field indicates the year in which an application to emigrate was made or granted.
      Destination
   
      This field includes the country, state or city that applicant intended to travel to e.g. UK.Wales. Cardiff.

The completed database offers a searchable record of individual migration from this estate and offers a comprehensive new source for the family historian. Similarly, the database provides interesting data on emigration from counties Waterford and Cork to various parts of the world during the period 1815-1905.

They are a very valuable source for researchers of family history.

It was in use from the early 19th century but only enclosed and laid out in 1877. There were a number of burials prior to the attempt to provide a plan for the burial ground. There is no register for these earlier burials. The first 426 plots on the burial register were left blank in the hope that the 'Burial Board' could fill in the details later but this never occurred. The first record from the burial register dates to 12th September 1862 and Waterford City and County Archive holds the original burial registers from 1862 until 1966 but there are some gaps. Unfortunately, burials did not always strictly adhere to the plan of burial plots laid out so further investigation may be required when searching for a plot found in the register.The Burial Registers are very large files and downloading the full register may take some time. They have also been broken down into sections. Please note you can enlarge the text on the PDF document for clearer viewing, but some entries are faded in the original register and may be difficult to decipher. To search, you will need to open the index first to get the plot number and then open the PDF for the location of that plot number.

All remains and objects and any other traces of human kind from past times are considered elements of the archaeological heritage. Protecting our Archaeological Heritage   

The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for the protection of our archaeological heritage, including the licensing of archaeological excavations, through the exercise of powers under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004. Monuments are protected under the National Monuments Acts in a number of ways:When the owner or occupier of a property, or any other person proposes to carry out, or to cause, or to permit the carrying out of any work at or in relation to a Recorded Monument they are required to give notice in writing to the Minister 2 months before commencing that work. This is to allow the National Monuments Service time consider the proposed works and how best to proceed to further the protection of the monument.For national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister or a local authority or which are subject to a preservation order, the prior written consent of the Minister is required for any works at or in proximity to the monument.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/heritage/built-heritage.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Built Heritage,"Our built heritage is part of the environment we live and work in. This heritage is a physical reminder of the culture, ideals, and history of previous generations. Castles, country houses, churches and public buildings, some of which were designed by architects, immediately come to mind. However, more modest structures such as town houses, thatched cottages and farm complexes also contribute to the character of the county. Waterford also has a rich industrial and maritime heritage, that includes structures such as mills, lighthouses, quays which tend to be overlooked. Our built heritage is an irreplaceable record which contributes to our understanding of both the present and the past. It is ours to enjoy, to enhance and to hand on to future generations.The importance of our architectural heritage is recognised through legislation. Part IV of The Planning and Development Act 2000 deals with Architectural Heritage and each local authority has a duty to protect structures or parts of structures which are of special interest. This is done by compiling and maintaining a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) for each local authority area.The documents are a mechanism for the statutory protection of architectural heritage and these RPS documents form part of the County and City Development Plans. There are almost 2000 structures on the RPS in the City and County of Waterford, including a variety of buildings from country houses, churches, bridges, houses, shops, thatched houses and stone depots and so on. The Record of Protected Structures can be updated at any stage during the life of the Development Plan.They are an irreplaceable record, which contributes to our understanding of both the present and the past. The built fabric of our past is to be valued and we have a duty to ensure that it is conserved and passed on the future generations as a central part of our common cultural heritage.This is done by compiling and maintaining a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) for the area. Please contact Rosemary Ryall, Executive Conservation Officer with regard to these documents.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/culture-heritage/heritage/conservation-faqs.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Built Heritage FAQs,"A protected structure is a structure or a part of a structure that a planning authority considers to be of special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view. Details of protected structures are entered by the authority in its Record of Protected Structures, which is part of the Development Plan. This can be updated at any stage during the life of the Development Plan. All up to date details will be on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).The owner and/or occupier of a protected structure is legally obliged to ensure that no danger is caused to the structure. This obligation applies from the time when an owner or occupier is notified of a proposal to include a structure in the Record of Protected Structures. At this time, the structure becomes a 'proposed protected structure'.Very few people go through the planning process without availing of the services of an Architect or other appropriately qualified individuals (referred to from here on as an Agent).   A planning consultant (agent) can guide you through the planning application process and can work with your architect where necessary to deliver a high quality and compliant planning application.  Employing a good agent guarantees a better chance of a positive result in a shorter timescale. Through their expertise, he/she will know what is required in a planning application reducing the need for a Further Information Request.The obligation to preserve a protected structure applies initially to all parts of the structure. This includes the interior, all land around it, and any other structures, and their interiors, on that land. This obligation also applies to any exterior or interior fixtures and fittings of a protected structure, or of any structure on land immediately within its cartilage.If a declaration is sought, the planning authority can clarify which, if any, parts of the structure or its surrounding cartilage are not of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, and do not require special protection.An owner or occupier of a protected structure must ensure that neither the structure nor any element of it is endangered. Endangering a structure may mean:

Under the planning system, many minor works to structures do not normally require planning permission. These works are known as exempted developments. However, for a protected structure, such works can be carried out without planning permission only if they would not affect the character of the structure, or any element of the structure that contributes to its special interest.You must seek clarification from the Planning Authority as to the type of works that would or would not materially affect the character of the structure, and which would or would not require planning permission. In the case of some structures where the decorative condition is of special interest, planning permission could be required for interior decorating, such as plastering or painting.An owner or occupier of a protected structure may request a declaration from the planning authority regarding the structure and its curtilage. This will indicate the types of works that can be carried out without affecting any element of the protected structure that contributes to its special architectural historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social and technical interest, and those works that cannot.Works that are normally exempt and do not affect the character of the structure do not require planning permission. However, owners or occupiers who carry out such works without a specific exemption in a declaration from the planning authority do so at their own risk. An owner or occupier may request a declaration from the planning authority at any time, even when not works are contemplated.Planning applications for protected structures are made in the same way as for any other planning application. However, a planning application for works to a protected structure will generally require more detail. This is because of the sensitivity of most protected structures to inappropriate works. The relevant newspaper and site notice for the application must indicate that it relates to a protected structure. Additional information on how the proposed development would affect the character of the structure must be submitted with the application. The local authority will notify other interested bodies, including the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Heritage Council and An Taisce, before making a decision.The Built heritage and Jobs Leverage Scheme 2014 is operated by the City and County Council to assist owners or occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.  An architectural conservation area is a place, area, group of structures or townscape that is either of special architectural, historical archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, or which contributes to the appreciation of protected structures. This could include a terrace of houses, buildings surrounding a palace, or any group of buildings that together give a special character to an area. In a rural setting, an architectural conservation area could include a group of structures associated with a mill or with a country house estate. An architectural conservation area can also include protected structures.  A planning authority, in its development plan, may designate an area as an architectural conservation area, to ensure that its character is preserved. Planning permission is normally required before works can be carried out to the exterior of a structure in an architectural conservation area.A planning application involving a structure in an architectural conservation area is generally made in the same way as any other planning application. The newspaper and site notice must indicate that the planning application relates to a structure in an architectural conservation area. Additional information on how the proposed development will affect the character of that area must be submitted with the application. The planning authority will notify other interested bodies, including Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Heritage Council and An Taisce, before making a decision on the application.It may be advisable to consult with your planning authority in advance of applying for permission for development, to ensure that your application is complete.

The campaign welcomed by local venue owners and managers as a positive step in raising the perception of safety in Waterford, will be fully in place for the busy Christmas party season. Eric O'Brien, Chair of the Purple Flag Working Group outlined that the 'Ask for Angela' campaign gives assurance that where required, informed assistance is available. He commended the support shown by venues who will display campaign posters encouraging those in a situation where they feel vulnerable to approach staff and ask for 'Angela'  - this code word will alert staff that help is needed to  get out of a situation discreetly. Angela was a play on the word (guardian) Angel. The posters are up in male and female toilets, and provide reassurance there is support available if needed."" The campaign has got global attention since introduced by Hayley Child in Lincolnshire, England in 2016.Michael Murphy, President of WIT Students Union commented that ""the ""˜Ask For Angela' campaign has the potential to make Waterford a safer place by encouraging people to discreetly ask for help by going to venue staff and 'Ask for Angela' - a phrase aimed at alerting staff so they can help defuse a situation. It is encouraging to see so many local businesses engaging with the campaign, all with a common objective to protect people who find themselves in vulnerable or distressing situations"".
 Purple Flag is a Gold Standard accreditation recognising Waterford for being a safe, welcoming and friendly destination to socialise, live and work in. Waterford was awarded the prestigious Purple Flag in February 2015 and it is international recognition of Waterford's successful, well-managed city centre. It can be seen as the equivalent of the Blue Flag awarded to good beaches.The Purple Flag award recognises excellence in the management of the evening and night-time economy and signifies the diverse range of offering available in Waterford after 5pm.  Within Waterford's compact and vibrant Purple Flag Zone you'll find a diverse range of family entertainment, arts and culture venues, shopping, dining, pubs and nightclubs, accommodation and transport - something for everyone.Waterford was first awarded the prestigious Purple Flag in February 2015 and is re-assessed each year under ACTM's (Association of City & Town Management) stringent standards including:

The building control system applies to the design and construction of new buildings, extensions and material alterations to, and certain changes of use of, existing buildings.  The Building Control section promotes good practice in the design and construction of buildings and we do this by visiting and inspecting building sites. As far as possible, we try to resolve problems by discussing them with the builder to find an agreed solution.  Occasionally, however, we serve enforcement notices where contraventions of the Regulations occur and, in certain cases, we can and do prosecute.  As well as inspecting buildings during construction, we have the authority to examine documents, drawings and other materials relevant to the work.Primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and building owners.  The power of inspection granted to the Building Control Authority under the legislation is discretionary and does not impose an obligation on the Building Control Authority to inspect all buildings during their construction.European Union (Construction Products) Regulations (S.I. 225 of 2013)

Waterford City & County Council,departments/environment/3-for-sea.htm,Waterford City & County Council : 3 For The Sea,"""Take 3 for the Sea"" is a simple idea: the campaign encourages people to take three pieces of plastic litter with them when they leave the beach, waterway or... anywhere!  We in Waterford are lucky to have a variety of beautiful beaches and coastline. We enjoy our beaches all year round, not just in the summer. And there are a number of groups and individuals who regularly collect litter from the coastline of our county, from Cheekpoint in the east to Whiting Bay in the west.  Plastic pollution cannot be ignored. Plastic is designed to last forever but is often used only once. Poorly managed plastic leaks into the sea and makes up 80% of all marine litter. The plastics that we see on our beaches are just a small part of marine litter. In fact, it's estimated that 70% of marine litter is on the seabed, 15% is floating in the water column and just 15% is what we see on our beaches. ""Take 3 for the Sea"" asks you to put three pieces of plastic in a litter bin or take it home with you to your own bin. Remember: all litter can eventually make its way to the sea, so any cleanup makes a change for the better.  A teacher's handbook has been developed to help both Primary and Secondary School teachers to explore marine litter, plastic pollution and single-use plastics with their class. This provides information on the topics and suggests activities to carry out with your class and will provide a useful starting point to explore this with pupils.Why not take the ""Take 3 for the Sea"" pledge today?

Waterford City & County Council,departments/environment/air-quality/index.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Air Pollution and Quality,"Air QualityClean air is essential for our quality of life.  While recent decades have seen significant  improvements in air quality in Ireland, air pollution continues to cause damage  to both our health and environment. The EPA's annual  €˜Air Quality in Ireland'  reports consistently state that Ireland's air quality is generally good, but  that some localised areas of concern remain. These arise mainly from  residential and transport emissions.
   In addition, the European Environment Agency states that air  pollution is linked to approx. 1,400 premature deaths in Ireland each year.  This is up to ten times the number of people who die on our roads. These deaths  arise from health conditions which are linked to air pollution, such as heart  disease, stroke, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases.
   A range of air quality legislation is therefore in place in  Ireland to protect our air quality and safeguard the health of all.   Air Quality MonitoringAir quality monitoring in Ireland is led by the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the national Ambient Air Quality  Monitoring Programme (AAMP). Real-time and historic data from all monitoring  stations across the State is available at all times at www.airquality.ie
   In addition, the EPA operates an Air Quality Index for  Health (AQIH), which runs on a scale from 1 (Good) to 10 (Very Poor). The  latest AQIH for all monitoring station locations is also available at all times  at www.airquality.ie.
   There are three permanent air pollution monitors in  Waterford, and the latest readings from these can be accessed below  Air Quality MonitoringWaterford  City and County Council has monitoring and enforcement responsibilities  and powers under a range of Air Quality legislation, including:

Waterford City & County Council,departments/environment/dog-control/microchipping.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Microchipping,"Microchipping of all dogs is now required by law under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 63 of 2015). From September 2015, all newborn pups are legally required to be microchipped and registered with an authorised database. This applies to all dogs from 31st March 2016.Micro-chipping is a simple and effective way to make sure that your pet can be easily identified should you become separated. A small microchip, (about the size of a grain of rice) is inserted under the loose skin on the back of your pet's neck. Your pet is registered on an authorised database that has been approved by the Dept of Agriculture, Food & Marine. A hand-held scanner at the nearest veterinary surgery or dog pound can easily read the chip when your pet is found and you will be reunited. Microchips for pets are about the size of a rice grain and are placed beneath the skin at a specific point by injection. Encoded on a the chip is a specific code number unique to the pet which is registered along with details of it's breed, sex, age and most importantly the owners name, address and telephone numbers.The main benefit of having them are that should your pet ever be lost or a dispute over ownership arise there is a quick and reliable way to establish the rightful owner. Pets can stray out of a garden when a gate is left open or if they manage to scale the wall or fence; they may be distracted on a walk and disappear away after wildlife or with other pets; sometimes they are injured while out on their own and may be brought to a vets surgery or a dog pound. In all these situations the quicker the owner can be reunited with the pet the less stress the pet will suffer. It is also very frustrating for Vets to have an animal brought in having been found wandering and having no way of identifying it although it may obviously be somebody's well loved pet.A combination of a microchip and an identity tag is probably the best solution to the problem.

Dog dirt is smelly, sticky, disgusting and can cause disease. Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2003, dog-owners are required to clean up after their dog if it fouls in a public place such as public roads, footpaths, parks or beaches.  Failure to do so can result in an on-the-spot fine of Ã¢ ‚ ¬150.  It is as easy as taking a bag with you every time you walk your dog in a public place. Tie a knot in the bag and dispose of in a litter bin or take it home for disposal. 
Owner Responsibilities   
Owning a dog is a big responsibility. Whether you already own a dog or are considering getting one, consider the following points :  Downloads

   Recycling turns our waste materials into new useful products. This reduces the use of finite raw materials, saves energy and helps control air, water and land pollution. Recycling is a group effort. We all have our part to play to make sure our recycling is properly sorted. Recycling that includes non-recyclable items or is contaminated with food waste can end up in landfill. It only takes a few minutes to rinse out plastic, glass & tin containers and sort your cardboard to avoid a disposal problem that will live with future generations for hundreds or even thousands of years.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/environment/temporary-signage.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Temporary Signage Regulations,"Waterford City & County Council recognises the value of advertising signs to visitors, customers, businesses, community groups etc. and to the general vitality and vibrancy of an area. It also, recognises, however, that they can have a negative environmental impact as well as being a hindrance to traffic safety and safe pedestrian movement. In order to achieve a reasonable balance, it is vital that the situation with regard to advertising signage is monitored and regulated, especially signage of a temporary nature. From a legislation and regulation perspective, advertising is governed by the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011, the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2003, the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the Roads Act 1993 and the regulations applying to these Acts. It is worth noting that certain signs are exempt under the above regulations, e.g. election posters, but even these have certain conditions and limitations.The aim of this policy is to support good, creative and necessary signage in appropriate places and for appropriate events, facilities and services. It is also to ensure that the overall presentation of the city and county and the image which it portrays to residents, visitors and potential investors is not negatively affected by inappropriate and unauthorised signage. The aim is not to be anti-business or anti-community but rather to support economic activity, quality of standards and consistency in decision-making and to generally portray a positive image of Waterford.The following are some of the issues which have been identified as being problematic with regard to advertising and signage in Waterford, in the city, towns and villages and even rural locations:

Waste is anything you discard, whether it has a value or not.
Unauthorised waste collectors often engage in illegal dumping and you are still responsible.
Before you give waste to anyone, ask to see their waste collection permit. This permit must list the waste type you are discarding.
Vehicles from authorised waste collectors must have their name and waste collection permit number on it.  Any advertisements must also give their name and waste collection permit number.

The Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2017 came into force on October 1st 2017.  These regulations replaced the existing 2007 regulations. The objective of the new regulations is to ensure the appropriate recovery of end of life tyres.To fund this recovery, the regulations require the implementation of a visible environmental management charge (vEMC) on tyres placed on the Irish market.  The vEMC will allow waste tyres to be collected for recovery when new tyres on which the vEMC has been paid are purchased.  This vEMC must be shown separately on every invoice, catalogue, advertisement and website where the price is shown, and shall include the words ""Included in these prices is a statutory contribution to recycling costs"".

There is currently no vEMC charge on agricultural and construction tyres.The regulations also impose obligations on persons who supply tyres to the Irish market, whether as manufacturers, wholesalers, suppliers, traders, or retailers and on the collectors of waste tyres (including facilities dealing in end of life vehicles) to register with a compliance scheme with an approved body. The only approved body for this purpose is  Circol ELT.
Farmers who wish to obtain tyres for use in covering silage pits will no longer be able to obtain these from tyre retailers.  To obtain these they must be registered with Circol ELT to allow them receive tyres from an authorised waste tyre collector, and will be limited to 8 tyres per square metre of any silage pits floor area.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/environment/waterford-energy-bureau/energy-efficiency.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Energy Efficiency ," To help Ireland reach the 2020 and 2030 goals of reducing CO2 emissions by 20% and 30% respectively, energy efficiency measures are key in order to reach those targets. As well as using energy saving tips they are major changes that can be made to Irish homes involving renewable technology. With the help of SEAI grants and the cost savings on bills such as heating and electricity, home renewable technologies are a cost effective way of upgrading a house energy rating. Ireland have a binding contract with the EU that by 2020, 20% of our total energy will be renewable and by 2030, 35% of our total energy will be renewable. Renewable energy is derived from natural resources that are continuously replenished. As well as being constantly replenished, renewable energy can be utilised without damaging the environment. Home renewable technology is considerably well developed and is constantly improving and becoming more efficient.
To help Ireland reach their renewable and CO2 targets, the following fact sheets have been prepared to provide homeowners with information on the available technologies and efficiency measures to help save energy costs and to improve the energy efficiency of houses. Energy-Saving Booklet
      Waterford City and County Council's Climate Action Team has published an Energy-Saving Booklet, developed in direct response to the ongoing global energy crisis which is adversely impacting households and businesses.Using a common-sense approach to energy saving, the booklet is intended to act as a baseline from which actions can be taken and built upon. While many may be familiar with the tips within, old habits may prevent us from realizing their benefits. Topics covered in the booklet include energy poverty, energy supplier guidance, household appliance energy usage and home energy upgrades.Energy Efficiency Low Cost Tips:
			  
			  There are lots of ways to make home more energy efficient and comfortable. See fact sheet 1 to view what small changes can be made that go a long way. Thermal Insulation/Windows & Doors:
			When a building is well insulated, not only does it save money but it makes living more comfortable. For the different types of insulation and draught proofing methods see fact sheet 2 and fact sheet 3. Heating system/ Domestic Hot Water:
		    Having an efficient heating system, reducing the amount of hot water used and the efficiency at which the water is heated is vital to reducing energy costs in the home and the impact it has on the environment. To see how to get the best out of heating see fact sheet 4. Lighting Efficiency Upgrades:
			Energy efficient lighting is the simplest change a householder can make to save energy. Savings in lighting energy usage can be as high as 85% compared to traditional lighting. To see the cost savings of efficient lighting see fact sheet 5. Energy Label:
			  
Labelling helps consumers to choose the most energy-efficient products, lowering energy bills and reducing impact on the environment. To understand how an energy label can help improve consumers choice see fact sheet 6. Heat Pumps:
		Heat-Pumps can help reduce energy costs for space heating and hot water production between 40-60%. To see the different types of Heat-Pumps and the cost savings when compared to traditional heating, see fact sheet 7. Energy Performance of Building Directive:
	Building Energy Rating is an indication of energy performance of a dwelling. Before availing of the SEAI grants for energy schemes a BER is required. To learn more about BER, see fact sheet 8. Solar Heating:
	Even with Ireland's overcast climate, solar heating is still an extremely viable option. The benefits of solar water far outweigh the upfront cost of the system. To learn about grants and the cost savings of solar heating, see fact sheet 9. Wood Fuels:
	Using wood biomass offers a renewable alternate to fossil fuels as its a carbon neutral process and will also create many jobs in the sector. To find more information on wood fuels, see fact sheet 10. Building Air Tightness:
	As well offering protection against dampness, air tightness ensures proper ventilation and sound protection. To find ways of improving air tightness, see fact sheet 13.

Our team are happy to discuss any balances  outstanding on your rates and what steps can be taken to ensure compliance with  the scheme.Why do we charge Commercial Rates?
	     Commercial Rates are a property-based source of income for local  authorities. Rates are a statutory charge, the income from which is used to  part-fund the annual revenue (day-to-day) expenditure of the local authority.  Rates originated in the 19th century and are essentially a property  tax on commercial premises. 
There are currently three primary sources of local government financing  which are universal amongst most countries. They are:
     
Central Government; Grants
Charges for Goods and Services and
Commercial Rates


Commercial Rates is one of the primary sources of Local Government funding and the income from Commercial Rates underpins the entire range of services  provided by local authorities. Commercial Rates are payable in equal moieties, the first on receipt  of the demand, and the second on 1st July each year.  Revenue Collectors have responsibility for the collection of Commercial Rates in Waterford City & County Council.

How are Commercial Rates Calculated? 
  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) is the figure used to calculate the annual Commercial Rates payable by the Occupier of a rateable property each year. This figure is determined by the elected members of the Council at the annual budget meeting each year, based on the deficit between Council income and expenditure for the forthcoming year. For 2023, the Annual Rate on Valuation is 0.2863. The Annual Rate on Valuation figure is multiplied by the Valuation amount of the premises as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.
For example: If your property has been valued at 20,000.00 by Tailte Éireann (formerly known as Valuation Office) then your Commercial Rates bill for 2023 will be: 20,000.00 X 0.2863 (ARV for 2023) = Ã¢ ‚ ¬5,726.00
Disclaimer: The Rates Calculation provided above gives you a sample rates liability for 2023.

What happens if there is a Change of  Occupant mid-year?
			  
 Owners of Commercial Properties are now obliged to notify the Local Authority, within 14 days of the transfer date, where there is a change in occupation of their property, i.e. when there is a change in tenancy or where a property is being sold, including where a property becomes vacant. The person transferring the property, either the owner or occupier are legally required to discharge all commercial rates for which he/she is liable at the date of transfer. 

Owners must complete a Section 11 Form within 14 days of the change taking place. Owners who do not notify the local authority within 14 days will incur a financial penalty. This penalty is an amount equivalent to up to two years of outstanding rates from the previous occupier. Any penalty due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property due to non-notification will remain a charge on the property. The penalty charge is not affected by the subsequent payment of the outstanding rates and it remains payable even after the outstanding rates have been paid.

Section 11 Form (Word)
Section 11 Form (PDF)

All ratepayers are reminded that they are legally required to pay all commercial rates due from them prior to their departure from a property or prior to the sale or transfer of an interest in a property.   Any rates due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property will remain a charge on the property.


What can I do if I am unhappy with the rates I am paying for my property?
The valuation of a property is determined by the Commissioner of Valuation (Tailte Éireann (formerly known as the Valuation Office), Irish Life Centre, Abbey Street Lower, Dublin 1). No alteration can be made to the rates assessment of a ratepayer until such time as the valuation of a property is amended by the Commissioner of Valuation. A ratepayer of the Council can seek to have the valuation on a property revised.  For further details you can contact  Tailte Éireann at 01 817 1000, email info@valoff.ie or log on to www.valoff.ie
  

What happens if I don't pay my Rates?
Failure to pay your Rates by the specified period will result in legal proceedings being issued, followed by a  Court Summons/Civil Proceedings. The Council may also register the debt as a judgement mortgage on a property. 

What is a Set off on Account (contra-entry)?
A situation can arise whereby a Commercial Rates customer will also be a supplier of goods or services to Waterford City & County Council. Should a situation arise whereby Waterford City & County Council owes money to a Commercial Rates customer for goods supplied or services rendered and at the same time Commercial Rates are outstanding from that customer, the local authority reserves the right to apply a setoff (contra-entry) on account. This effectively allows for the payment of rates to be funded by way of amounts owing by the local authority to the rates customer. Section 58 of the Local Government Act 1941 facilitates this action.

What is Entry Year Property Levy?
The Entry Year Property Levy (PEL) is a charge which the local authority applies to newly erected or newly constructed properties pending the levying of commercial rates. It was introduced for the first time in 2008 under the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, which was enacted on the 24th December 2006.
PEL is  only charged in the year before the property becomes active in the Rate Book.

How is the Entry Year Property Levy Calculated? 
The charge is calculated by reference to:
Rateable valuation on the property as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.

The annual rate on valuation (ARV) as determined by the Council.
The date (entry date) the property is valued for rating purposes (i.e. entered in the valuation list).
The number of days from the effective valuation date to the end of the year

What happens if there is a Change of  Occupant mid-year?
			  
 Owners of Commercial Properties are now obliged to notify the Local Authority, within 14 days of the transfer date, where there is a change in occupation of their property, i.e. when there is a change in tenancy or where a property is being sold, including where a property becomes vacant. The person transferring the property, either the owner or occupier are legally required to discharge all commercial rates for which he/she is liable at the date of transfer. 

Owners must complete a Section 11 Form within 14 days of the change taking place. Owners who do not notify the local authority within 14 days will incur a financial penalty. This penalty is an amount equivalent to up to two years of outstanding rates from the previous occupier. Any penalty due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property due to non-notification will remain a charge on the property. The penalty charge is not affected by the subsequent payment of the outstanding rates and it remains payable even after the outstanding rates have been paid.

Section 11 Form (Word)
Section 11 Form (PDF)

All ratepayers are reminded that they are legally required to pay all commercial rates due from them prior to their departure from a property or prior to the sale or transfer of an interest in a property.   Any rates due and outstanding by an owner of relevant property will remain a charge on the property.


What can I do if I am unhappy with the rates I am paying for my property?
The valuation of a property is determined by the Commissioner of Valuation (Tailte Éireann (formerly known as the Valuation Office), Irish Life Centre, Abbey Street Lower, Dublin 1). No alteration can be made to the rates assessment of a ratepayer until such time as the valuation of a property is amended by the Commissioner of Valuation. A ratepayer of the Council can seek to have the valuation on a property revised.  For further details you can contact  Tailte Éireann at 01 817 1000, email info@valoff.ie or log on to www.valoff.ie
  

What happens if I don't pay my Rates?
Failure to pay your Rates by the specified period will result in legal proceedings being issued, followed by a  Court Summons/Civil Proceedings. The Council may also register the debt as a judgement mortgage on a property. 

What is a Set off on Account (contra-entry)?
A situation can arise whereby a Commercial Rates customer will also be a supplier of goods or services to Waterford City & County Council. Should a situation arise whereby Waterford City & County Council owes money to a Commercial Rates customer for goods supplied or services rendered and at the same time Commercial Rates are outstanding from that customer, the local authority reserves the right to apply a setoff (contra-entry) on account. This effectively allows for the payment of rates to be funded by way of amounts owing by the local authority to the rates customer. Section 58 of the Local Government Act 1941 facilitates this action.

What is Entry Year Property Levy?
The Entry Year Property Levy (PEL) is a charge which the local authority applies to newly erected or newly constructed properties pending the levying of commercial rates.

PEL is  only charged in the year before the property becomes active in the Rate Book.

How is the Entry Year Property Levy Calculated? 
The charge is calculated by reference to:
Rateable valuation on the property as determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.

The annual rate on valuation (ARV) as determined by the Council.
The date (entry date) the property is valued for rating purposes (i.e. entered in the valuation list).

Waterford City & County Council,departments/housing/housing-assistance-payment.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Housing Assistance Payment,"HAP is a new form of housing support provided by local authorities. The introduction of HAP will mean that local authorities can now provide housing assistance for households who qualify for social housing support, including many long-term rent supplement recipients. Under HAP, local  authorities will make a monthly rental payment on behalf of the HAP recipient  directly to the landlord, but the rent paid is subject to terms and conditions,  including rent limits. The HAP recipient will then pay a rent contribution to the local authority. The rent contribution is a differential rent - that is, a rent based on income and the ability to pay.Housing Assistance Payment Limits have increased

Who is eligible for HAP? 
  Any household that qualifies for social housing support is eligible to apply for HAP.  Current rent supplement recipients who qualify for social housing support will be transferred from rent supplement to HAP on a phased basis.  
  
  Who is eligible for HAP and how does it work? 
  In order to qualify for HAP, a household must be qualified for social housing support by their local authority, which means the household must qualify to go on the local authority housing waiting list.
  HAP allows recipients to take up full-time employment, while still receiving housing support.  The rent contribution payable by the HAP recipient is based on the differential rent scheme for their local authority. This scheme links the rent contribution a household must pay to the household's income and the ability to pay. If a HAP recipient leaves their HAP property without the local authority's permission, they will be suspended for a period of one year from all housing supports including homeless services and their time on the housing list will also be suspended for one year.Information for Landlords   
   The landlord will receive prompt payments directly from the local authority on a monthly basis, subject to the HAP recipient paying the local authority their rent contribution.

Applicants must be in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months to qualify.For more information about the Rental Accommodation Scheme, please contact our Rental Accommodation Unit at 058-22007.How does RAS work? 
 Under RAS, your local authority will help secure a longer contract of tenancy with your existing landlord and will pay rent directly to the landlord for you. You will still pay rent but you will pay it to the local authority. The rent you pay will be based on your income and will be assessed in accordance with Waterford City & County Council's Differential Rent Scheme.What are the benefits of RAS? 
RAS will give you longer-term housing security. RAS will also ensure that the quality and standard of your private rented accommodation is adequate. Unlike Rent Supplement you can take up employment when on RAS. If you get a job, you can stay on the scheme but your rent will be reassessed based on your new income.Am I eligible for RAS? 
 You will qualify for the scheme if you have been receiving Rent Supplement for a minimum of 18 months and you have been assessed by the local authority as having a long-term housing need. RAS does not apply to asylum seekers or non-nationals who do not have permission to remain in Ireland permanently.Will I have to move to new accommodation? 
If the accommodation in which you live meets the standards for rented houses and your landlord is willing to participate in RAS, you will be able to remain in your current accommodation. Your current accommodation must be appropriate to your housing need e.g. number of bedrooms.  If your accommodation is sub-standard and/or your landlord is not willing to engage with the scheme, you will be advised to source alternative accommodation. If your accommodation is not appropriate to your housing need you will also be advised to source alternative, appropriate accommodation.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/housing/repair-leasing-initiative.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Housing : Vacant Housing Repair and Leasing Initiative,"A key component of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is a new scheme, the Vacant Housing Repair and Leasing Initiative, which targets the delivery of social housing and also ensures that existing housing stock is used to the maximum degree possible. Waterford City and County Council have piloted and progressed the initiative with Department of Housing Planning Community and Local Government support.The basis of the scheme is that repair and improvement works to suitable vacant properties are funded to bring them up to the standard for rented accommodation and the cost of the works is then deducted from lease payments over an agreed lease term.Waterford City & County Council will assist property owners to develop the scope of works and also aid the property owner in the completion of the repair works. Property inspections are carried out by Waterford City & County Council staff who will identify the works required to bring the dwelling to the required standard. Properties in all areas will be considered but particular demand is in Waterford City, Dungarvan and Tramore. Please contact Waterford City & County Council Housing Supply Section for further details or complete and return an enquiry form, available below.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/planning/enforcement/index.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Planning Enforcement,"Where unauthorised development comes to the attention of the Planning Authority, the Planning Authority may conduct a site visit, examine the planning history of the site and may serve a 'Warning Letter' or an 'Enforcement Notice'. The following sections provide information on the various issues pertaining to planning enforcement.Please note that the information provided herein is for guidance only. It does not purport to provide a legal interpretation of the legislative provisions referred to nor can it be regarded as definitive or having any legal effect.
What is an Unauthorised Development?
   
      All development carried out requires planning permission unless it is exempted development as set out in the Planning & Development Regulations 2001 (as amended). Equally, any development carried out on foot of planning permission must comply with the planning conditions set down in the permission granted. Care should be taken to ensure that each condition of a permission is fully complied with, in order to avoid incurring enforcement action, and also to avoid difficulties when the property is being sold at a later date. In summary, any development that does not have the benefit of exempted development status, or is not being carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted constitutes unauthorised development. The Planning Authority has the power to stop unauthorised development.Who enforces planning decisions?
   
      The enforcement of unauthorised development is the responsibility of the Planning Authority, which has wide enforcement powers to ensure that either a development is carried out in conformity with planning permission, or in accordance with the exempted development thresholds as set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended).

Through their expertise, he/she will know what is required in a planning application reducing the need for a Further Information Request.The Site Notice must be securely erected and located in a conspicuous position, be easily visible and be legible by persons using the public road. The site notices must be of a durable and weatherproofed material.The site notice must be placed on site for five weeks from the date of receipt of the planning application. If it becomes illegible or is removed, it must be replaced immediately as failure to do so will delay the processing of the planning application. If a subsequent planning application is made on the same site within six months of the first application, the site notice must be in yellow.Site Location Map (6 copies) - The Site Location Map must be marked or coloured so as to clearly identify the land or structure to which the application relates and the boundaries thereof. The Site Location Map must be on an Ordnance Survey map with the number of the Ordnance Survey map clearly indicated, together with the north point. The scale of the map should be not less that 1:1000 in built-up areas and 1:1250 in all other areas.
 
Site/Layout Map (6 copies) - The site boundary should be clearly marked in red and the plan should show buildings, boundaries, septic tanks and percolation areas, bored wells, services and other features in the vicinity of the land or structure. In this regard, all features within 100m of the proposed development should be indicated. The position of the site notice should also be shown. The scale of the layout map should not be less than 1:500. The site boundaries cannot be changed once the application has been validated.
Plans & Drawings (6 copies) (except for Outline Permission ) - Plans and Drawings should contain detailed structural drawings of floor plans, elevations and sections and such other particulars as are necessary to describe the works or structure to which the application relates.

Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended by E.C. Directive 97/11/EC, requires that certain public and private projects require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before development consent is given. The type of projects listed in Annex I and Annex II of the Directive include factories, chemical installations and pharmaceutical plants, textile, leather, wood and paper industries, intensive pig-rearing and poultry installations, etc. The European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 to 1999 were made by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government incorporating the E.C. Directive into Irish law. These Regulations have been subsumed into the Planning & Development Regulations, 2001 which list the developments which must be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).Consultation with the Planning Authority is advisable prior to submitting an application for permission where an EIS is or may be required. Where an EIS is applicable, six copies of an Environmental Impact Statement must be submitted as part of the application.  Natura 2000 sites are those identified as sites of Community importance designated under the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora) i.e. a Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), or the Birds Directive (Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds) i.e. Special Protection Areas (SPAs).The Habitats Directive requires Appropriate Assessments (AA) to be undertaken where a plan or project, which may not be directly linked to a Natura Site but which may give rise to significant effects upon a Natura 2000 site. Therefore where a proposed development is likely to have adverse effects on the integrity of a ""˜non-priority' site of international importance for nature conservation, permission should only be granted where there is no alternative solution and where there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest in favour of granting permission, including those of a social or economic nature.  For any works proposed to be carried out to Protected Structures (PS) as identified on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) or proposed Protected Structures, a detailed Architectural Conservation Impact Report and associated Method Statement shall accompany a planning application.Where planning applications involve works to or redevelopment of a building or structure identified on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) the Planning Authority may require an Architectural Heritage Impact Assessment to be prepared commensurate to the nature and scale of the proposal. Where development involves Architectural Conservation Areas (ACAs), the Planning Authority may require an Architectural Impact Assessment to be carried out in order to ensure the protection from inappropriate actions which could materially affect the external character. For development within Archaeological Sites and in Zones of Archaeological Potential, the Planning Authority will have regard to the view and recommendation of the National Monuments Service and other interested bodies, such as the Heritage Council.   The Planning Authority may request additional information in order to adjudicate on the planning application through a Further Information Request. In this case, the applicant has 6 months to respond to this request. The Planning Authority must make its decision within 4 weeks of the date of receipt of a full response to the request.In some cases a Request for Clarification of the further information submitted may be made and in this case the applicant must submit clarification within 6 months from the date of the initial Further Information Request. In cases where an Environmental Impact Statement has been submitted as part of the application, the timescale for making a decision on foot of the further information received is 8 weeks, rather than the usual 4 weeks. The period can vary, particularly if the Planning Authority seeks further information from the Applicant (which must be done within the first eight weeks). The Planning Authority has then four weeks from the day the further information is received to make a decision on the application. /

The timescale of the decision process is dependent upon the validity and completeness of the application and the possibility of the local authority decision being subsequently appealed to An Bord PleanÃƒÂ¡la. There is a time limit of eight weeks from when a valid application is lodged to a decision being given by the planning authority. The planning authority may issue a decision on the application (grant or refuse permission) or they may request further information. If the Planning Authority requests further information, it has four weeks from the day the further information is received to make a decision on the application (unless the application is accompanied by an Environmental Impact Statement, in which case, the time for making a decision is extended to 8 weeks. Any appeal of the decision must be submitted within four weeks of the local authority decision to An Bord PleanÃƒÂ¡la which has an objective to decide appeals within 18 weeks of receipt.The following list illustrates the timescale adhered to for most planning applications.The standard duration of a planning permission is:In accordance with Section 28 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 as amended and regulations made there under, the Planning Authority may, in certain circumstances extend the life of a planning permission. You can apply to the Planning Authority for an extension of duration of a planning permission within one year from, and prior to the expiry date of the permission.  Please note that if your development is not substantially complete and includes a waste water treatment system and if your permission was assessed prior to the implementation of the EPA Code of Practice, then your application for extension of duration will not be considered favourably unless an application to upgrade the septic tank/waste water treatment system in accordance with the EPA Code of Practice is submitted to and granted by the Planning Authority prior to submitting an application for an extension of duration.The application form for an extension of duration is available here.Ireland's planning system was introduced on the 1st October 1964, when ""The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963"" came into effect.We are unique among European countries in that we have an independent third party planning appeals system which is operated by An Bord PleanÃƒÂ¡la.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for planning legislation. For more information and to download the relevant planning legislation documents, please visit here.On receipt of a final grant of permission, should you wish to commence development you are required to lodge a Commencement Notice.Please note that in accordance with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations S.I. 9 of 2014, from 1st March 2014 new Commencement Notice procedures apply.Full Commencement Notice 

The new requirement will apply to:Short Commencement Notice 

A ""˜Short' Commencement Notice may be submitted for the following categories of development:Yes, help is available from the following sources.
 Once a planning application is lodged, it is checked by the Planning staff to confirm that all necessary forms, plans and maps have been submitted. 
If the application form is not fully completed, necessary documentation is absent or incorrect information is submitted, the application will be deemed invalid and will be returned to the applicant. To avoid this, please ensure that each section of the application from is appropriately completed and signed, entering n/a (not applicable) where appropriate.  Also, please ensure that all necessary additional documentation is enclosed with the application form. For assistance in completing the planning forms, guidelines are included in the Planning Application Form pack. Once it is confirmed that an application is compliant with the statutory requirements and that all necessary documentation has been submitted, the application is considered valid. The 5-week submission period and the 8 week decision period commences from the date of receipt of the valid application.The Planning Authority welcomes pre-validation meetings with a validation officer for larger applications. Typical applications which may require a pre-validation meeting are applications for housing estates, applications which require an EIS, etc.You can check if there is an existing planning permission on the site or previous applications made on/adjacent to the site using the online map or text based Planning Enquiries System. Alternatively, you may also apply for the Planning Authority to carry out the planning history search on your behalf. To avail of this service, on the receipt of a request letter, an accompanying site location map (which clearly identifies the extent of the site) and the prescribed fee (Ã¢Â‚Â¬100 payable by cheque or credit card) you will be issued with a planning history report for the site within 4 weeks. You should ensure that you have answered the following questions:Copyright Â© Waterford City & County Council

Local authorities are  responsible for identifying the land that is subject to RZLT. Introduction
The Residential Zoned Land Tax was introduced in the Finance Act 2021.  The objective of the tax is to activate land that is serviced and zoned for  residential use or mixed use, including residential use, in order to increase  housing supply and to ensure regeneration of vacant and idle lands in urban  areas. These areas have been identified within statutory land use plans as  appropriate locations for housing and they have benefitted from investment in  the key services to support the delivery of housing.  Land subject to RZLT
The process to identify and map land that is subject to RZLT is  undertaken annually by local authorities. 

The initial mapping process has involved local authorities publishing  draft and supplemental maps and allowing landowners, and others, to make  submissions on these maps. Submissions by landowners could challenge the  inclusion of their land on a map, the date on which land first met the relevant  criteria, or they could seek to re-zone the land. The Waterford City and County Council final RZLT  map for 2024 is now available : SEE HERE FOR RZLT MAPThe map includes lands that meet the relevant criteria for inclusion on the map as set out in the current legislation.The final map does not reflect appeal decisions or judicial review  decisions made after 1 November 2023 regarding land identified on the draft or  supplemental maps published in November 2022 and May 2023, respectively.  Where these decisions are made by 1 January  2024, they will be reflected on the draft revised final map for 2025 - see  below.  The revised final map will  be published by 31 January from 2025 onwards. Residential Zoned Land Tax will be charged  annually from 1 February 2025 onwards (subject to the passing of Finance (No.2)  Bill 2023). The tax will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners and  landowners will have to register for the tax - further information regarding  the administration of the tax by Revenue is available here.  Where can I view Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) Annual Draft Map for 2025?How do I make a submission?Submissions can be made from 1 February 2024 until 1 April 2024:""¢ Online by registering on https://consult.waterfordcouncil.ieor""¢ In writing marked  €œResidential Zoned Land Tax € to the Planning Department, Waterford City and County Council, Menapia Building, The Mall, Waterford City.Please note that although they are included on the map, residential properties are not subject to RZLT if they are subject to Local Property Tax.   It is not necessary to make a submission to remove this type of residential property from the map.

The reforms  are primarily aimed at addressing the impact on the private rental market by  the use of residential homes for short-term tourism type letting in areas of  high housing demand. 

 Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ)These provisions apply in areas  designated as  €œRent Pressure Zones € (RPZ) under the Residential Tenancies Act  2004, as amended. On 4 of June 2019, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act  2019 introduced changes to the qualifying criteria to designate an RPZ.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/planning/vacant-sites-register.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Vacant Sites Register,"Background
    
Under Section 6 of the Urban Regeneration & Housing Act 2015 all planning authorities are required to establish and maintain a Vacant Sites Register as and from January 1st 2017. Following assessment by the planning authority, vacant sites shall be entered on the register where they have been vacant for a minimum period of 12 months preceding their assessment, have an area in excess of 0.05 hectares, are zoned for either residential or regeneration purposes and are consistent with the following criteria as set out in the Act:In the case of residential land:
In the case of regeneration land:
The Council is currently assessing a number of sites for possible inclusion on the register with particular emphasis on sites which are suitable for housing. It is a requirement of the Act that for a site to be entered on the register details of ownership and the market value pertaining to the site are fully set out in the register.The Vacant Sites Register and Levy  
The register is now being established with all relevant data and will be fully populated in the coming months. As part of this process the planning authority will notify property owners before 1 June 2017 that their sites are being placed on the register. Thereafter, on demand being made by the planning authority, the owner of the vacant site will be liable for payment of the levy (calculated by the planning authority at 3% of the market value of the site) in respect of each year until the site is no longer vacant.  Levies will be charged every year beginning with 2018 while payment will be due in January for all levies due in the preceding year. Appeals Process  

When notified by the planning authority of its intention to include a site on the register, a property owner may object to the proposed inclusion and can make a submission to the planning authority within 28 days. Having considered the submission the planning authority may proceed to enter the site onto the register or not proceed to do so as the case may be. If the site is to be placed on the register the planning authority must notify the property owner of the decision and the owner may, within 28 days, appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála. No further action will be taken in terms of the proposed entry until such time as the appeal has been determined by An Bord Pleanála.The planning authority is obliged to determine the market value of a vacant site as soon possible after the site is entered on the register, and at least once every 3 years thereafter, and notify the owner accordingly. The owner may appeal this valuation to the Valuation Tribunal within 28 days of the notice.  Subject to the right of appeal on a point of law to the High Court, the decision of the Valuation Tribunal is final.Prior to 1 June 2018, the planning authority must notify owners of any vacant site which stands entered on the register on 1 January 2018 that the levy for 2018 will fall due in January 2019. An owner of a vacant site who receives a demand for payment of the levy may appeal the demand to An Bord Pleanála within 28 days of the date of the demand on grounds that the site is no longer vacant or that the calculation of the levy is incorrect. If such an appeal is upheld, An Bord Pleanála will instruct the planning authority to either remove the entry from the register and cancel the demand accordingly or to amend the demand so as to identify the correct amount of the levy due.Links

Waterford City & County Council,departments/roads-parking/active-travel/index-old.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Active Travel,"You may have heard of the term  €œActive Travel € but what does it mean  exactly?

To put simply, Active Travel is making a journey by Walking, Cycling or  similar sustainable modes (think skateboards, roller skates, non-motorised  scooters). These journeys are usually short like walking to the shop or school  and cycling to work.

It can be a hard task to leave our cars at home, but we can try to make  small steps to change our habits. Next time you need a loaf of bread why not  walk to the shop. Maybe dedicate one or two days a week where you walk or cycle  to school with your children. If you do have to use your car, try to  €œActive  Travel € for part of the journey.

Travel Smarter - Not HarderOur planet is under severe stress due to Climate Change and we can all  play a part in making a change for the better. Active Travel is a great way to  start. 

Our roads and streets were originally designed and built for people.  Over time we changed our thought process and designed for cars. Now our road  networks cannot handle the volume of traffic. Even with more efficient cars we  still cause a huge environmental impact through congestion and pollution.But Active Travel is not just of benefit to our planet, it has a big effect  on our people.Physical & Mental  Health improvements - Active Travel has  clear benefits for us in terms of our physical health but also can improve our  mental health. Spending that little bit more time outdoors can really keep us  grounded. 

Quicker Journeys - You're not going to get from one end of the  country to the other in a faster time than a car, but you might just get to  work a bit quicker on a bike. Remember, short journeys are where you will see  the big advantage.

Reduce Carbon  Emissions - This is a big one  if we are to save our planet from the effects of Climate Change. By reducing our car journeys, we can reduce pollution and make our public realms cleaner and healthier places to use.

Save Money - Walking is free! You can also make significant savings by using your bike instead of using expensive fuel in your car. The Bike to work scheme also provides tax relief for people who cycle to  work. 

Safer Routes to Schools - By encouraging our children to walk or cycle to school we can make a big impact on their safety  and wellbeing. Congestion at the school gates is often a major issue but Active Travel can help to create safer access options.

Reduce Traffic Congestion - By leaving our cars at home we will greatly reduce congestion on our roads. We also create easier access to local shops and amenities to enjoy.  

More Social Interaction - We tend to neglect our social health when we are isolated in our cars. Active Travel encourages more social interaction because we see more of each other on our journeys. The Active Travel programme will pursue the development and delivery of high-quality walking and cycling facilities for use by people of all age groups in our every-day travel.

The programme will proactively engage with the public, local interest groups, public service providers and public representatives to identify opportunities, developed ideas, deliver schemes and promote and encourage the use of these facilities in our day-to-day lives. The schemes delivered will aim to strengthen connections in communities, energise our public spaces and make walking and cycling attractive, safe and accessible to everyone. 

The Active Travel programme will seek to contribute to tackling climate change by providing the opportunity to use  €œgreen € and sustainable transport options and integrate scheme designs with new and existing public transport systems. Your community group can stay in touch with Active Travel proposals in your area.Register your group with the Public Participation Network.

Accordingly public free parking for EVs within the Council's pay and display car parks and streets will cease from 1st February, 2023.
The Council will continue to operate free parking for EV and PHEV vehicles while charging at designated public EV charging points throughout Waterford City and County.
The Council will also be facilitating a significant investment which will see 12 new fast EV charging points being delivered across the city and county during 2023.
If you have any further queries in relation to this matter please contact our Customer Services Department on 0818 10 20 20.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/water/bathing-water/index.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Bathing Water,"Bathing Areas of County Waterford 
 Six bathing waters in county Waterford are formally designated as bathing areas under national legislation. These are the major bathing areas of Ardmore, Bunmahon, Clonea, Dunmore Councillors' Strand, Dunmore Main strand and Tramore. This designation means that they each have detailed management plans called ""˜Bathing Water Profiles' which includes assessment and management of all potential pressures on bathing water quality from the catchment area. Designated bathing waters are also formally monitored and classified based on results of water quality monitoring.In addition to the six designated bathing waters, twelve ""˜medium size' bathing areas (Woodstown, Guillamene, Newtown Cove, Ballyquin, Curragh, Goat Island, Annestown, Ballyvooney, Boatstrand, Kilfarrassey, Whiting Bay, and Stradbally Cove) and eleven ""˜small size' areas (Abbeyside, Baile na nGall, Ballydowane, Ballinacourty, Ballyvoyle, Garrarus, Cuan Heilbhic, Kilmurrin Cove, Owenashad River, Seapark and Tramore Pier) are also included in the council's monitoring programme. The major bathing areas are tested every 2 weeks, the medium every 4 weeks and the small at least once during the season, which runs from June 1st to September 15th. Members of the public should note that inclusion of an area for testing or the provision of life saving equipment does not automatically infer that bathing is recommended by Waterford City & County Council.Waterford City & County Council annually reviews the list of designated bathing areas, focusing mainly on usage by the public, and we encourage public participation in the identification process in relation to the establishment, review and updating of designated bathing waters. Members of the public are invited to make submissions to Waterford City and County Council by letter to Water Services, Waterford City & County Council, Civic Offices, Dungarvan, or email to contact@waterfordcouncil.ie
Water Testing   
     A total of 30 bathing areas are monitored during the bathing season. Bathing waters are monitored in respect of the bacterial indicators intestinal enterococci and E coli and inspections are carried out for other pollution such as tarry residues, glass, plastic, rubber or any other waste. Testing of bathing waters is conducted, on behalf of Waterford City & County Council, by the Environmental Health section of the Health Service Executive.Testing frequencies are tailored to the size and usage of each beach as outlined above.If a situation arises that could be expected to have an adverse impact on bathing water quality and the health of bathers, then the Council will ensure that timely and adequate measures, including the provision of information to the public are taken, including, if necessary, prohibition of or advice against bathing.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/water/waste-water.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Water Services Department,"Households that are not served by public sewers usually depend on wastewater treatment systems, either proprietary systems or septic tanks, to treat and dispose of wastewater. A well designed, installed, and maintained wastewater treatment system can provide years of reliable low-cost service.When systems fail to operate effectively, property damage, ground and surface water pollution, and disease outbreaks can occur. Therefore, it makes good sense to understand and care for your wastewater treatment system.What is a Wastewater Treatment System?   

A wastewater treatment system is a piece of infrastructure into which the raw sewage from the house enters and is partially treated. The partially treated effluent is then discharged to a percolation area for final treatment and eventual disposal to ground.Wastewater treatment systems come in various shapes and sizes and are normally located in your garden. Wastewater treatment systems accept all waste water from your house, which includes toilet, shower, sink, kitchen and washing machine wastewater. A percolation area typically consists of a system of sub-surface perforated pipes, which allows the liquid to drain into the surrounding soil.

How does a Wastewater Treatment System work?  

A wastewater treatment works like a simple sewage treatment works and the partially treated effluent drains from the tank's outlet pipe via a distribution box to the percolation area.
The wastewater is collected in the tank. Heavier solid material entering the tank will sink to the bottom. This is called sludge. The materials that remain near the top of the tank (oil, fat, and grease) are called scum.
Naturally occurring bacteria which are present in the sewage are encouraged to breed within the tank and digest the solids. Over time, partially decomposed solids build up on the bottom of the tank. This sludge has to be removed regularly to ensure that the system continues to work properly and to prevent the percolation area becoming blocked. 
After the partially treated wastewater leaves the tank it flows into the percolation area trenches. In the percolation area, holes at the bottom of each distribution pipe allow the wastewater to drain into gravel trenches for temporary storage. 
The soil below the percolation area provides the final treatment and disposal of the wastewater treatment effluent. As the effluent passes into the soil, most of it percolates downwards and outwards. The soil then filters the effluent as it passes through the pore spaces.
How can I tell if my Wastewater Treatment System is developing problems? 
Warning lights are flashing;
Sewage surfacing over percolation area;
Sewage back-ups in the house;
Slow draining toilets or drains;
Sewage odours;
Lush, green growth over the percolation area;
These problems tend to arise due to blocked pipes or excessive build up of solids in the tank. You may be able to clear pipe blockages by using drain rods but in some cases you may need to call a qualified plumber. The tank may also require emptying.
How do I care for my Wastewater treatment System? 
Keep records of when it was last cleaned and inspected by the manufacturer.
Do monthly inspections of the area around the tank. Prevention is always better than cure, as, once damage is caused to the drainage system, replacement is often the only option. In the long term it pays to be vigilant.

What are the DOs and DON'Ts for my Wastewater Treatment System? 
DOs
DO: divert other sources of water, like roof drains away from the wastewater treatment system. Excessive water upsets the system.
DO: set up maintenance contracts with the suppliers of the system.
DO: desludge the tank as often as is necessary.
DO: act immediately if there is a sign of any blockage or any sign of pollution.

DON'Ts
DON'T: use bleaches and disinfectant, or use sparingly, as they could kill the bacteria that help to digest the waste.
DON'T: use your toilet as a rubbish bin, or poison your system by pouring harmful chemicals, cleansers, oil or grease down the drain.
DON'T: flush rags, disposable nappies, kitchen towels, wipes, sanitary items or cotton buds down the toilet.
DON'T: enter a wastewater treatment plant. Toxic gases are produced by the natural treatment processes and can kill in minutes.
DON'T: allow anyone to drive or park over any part of the system.
DON'T: plant anything over or near the percolation area except grass. Roots from nearby trees and shrubs may clog and damage the drain lines.
DON'T: wash paint brushes in the sink or put brush cleaning liquids into the drains leading to the wastewater treatment system. Please dispose of these in an environmentally- friendly way.
DON'T: use caustic solutions to open blocked drains - use drain rods instead

How often should I have the Wastewater Treatment System cleared?   

Wastewater treatment systems need periodic check-ups and proper care to remain healthy and function properly. It is recommended that a wastewater treatment should be emptied once a year; this period may be extended depending on the system's size and usage. A check should be carried out regularly to see whether or not it needs desludging. The percolation area should also be checked for sogginess or flooding. If the system works well it will not smell.

Why should I maintain my Wastewater Treatment System?   

Failing wastewater treatment systems can:
Cause a serious health threat to your family and neighbours;
Pollute groundwater;
Be very expensive to repair;
Reduce the value of your property;
Put drinking water supplies at risk.
You are also responsible for ensuring that :

The wastewater treatment system is properly maintained and is emptied regularly;
The wastewater treatment system access lids are secure and in good working order; and
The drains to and from the wastewater treatment system, including the percolation area are free-flowing and free from blockages.
What should I look for when purchasing a new property?   
Before buying a home, check that the design capacity of the wastewater treatment system and percolation area will adequately serve the anticipated number of occupants of the house.
Ask if a maintenance log is kept. Check that the wastewater treatment system is in good structural order and has no history of problems. 
Ensure that the percolation area is inspected for evidence of flooding. Your Building Society or Bank valuation is unlikely to cover these aspects adequately and a competent surveyor should carry out all these checks and inspections.

It is recommended that a wastewater treatment should be emptied once a year; this period may be extended depending on the system's size and usage. A check should be carried out regularly to see whether or not it needs desludging. The percolation area should also be checked for sogginess or flooding. If the system works well it will not smell.

Why should I maintain my Wastewater Treatment System?   

Failing wastewater treatment systems can:
Cause a serious health threat to your family and neighbours;
Pollute groundwater;
Be very expensive to repair;
Reduce the value of your property;
Put drinking water supplies at risk.
You are also responsible for ensuring that :

The wastewater treatment system is properly maintained and is emptied regularly;
The wastewater treatment system access lids are secure and in good working order; and
The drains to and from the wastewater treatment system, including the percolation area are free-flowing and free from blockages.
What should I look for when purchasing a new property?   
Before buying a home, check that the design capacity of the wastewater treatment system and percolation area will adequately serve the anticipated number of occupants of the house.
Ask if a maintenance log is kept. Check that the wastewater treatment system is in good structural order and has no history of problems. 
Ensure that the percolation area is inspected for evidence of flooding. Your Building Society or Bank valuation is unlikely to cover these aspects adequately and a competent surveyor should carry out all these checks and inspections.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/water/water-schemes.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Water Schemes,"East Waterford Water Supply Scheme     
This scheme is the primary water supply in Co. Waterford. It supplies potable water to Waterford City and the eastern parts of the county including Tramore and Dunmore East.The East Waterford Water Supply Scheme (EWWSS) was originally constructed and commissioned in 1984 to provide 25,000m approx. of potable water on a daily basis. Since then, steady population growth and increases in commercial/industrial development and tourism in the eastern region of County Waterford has demanded a significant increase in the capacity of the potable water supply facilities for the region. Waterford County Council appointed MC O'Sullivan Consulting Engineers (now RPS Consulting Engineers) to initially examine and report on the feasibility of expanding the overall capacity of the EWWSS, while conforming with the various Environmental Legislation, Directives and Regulations governing the sourcing, treatment and supply of drinking water in Ireland.Design proposals were approved by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, outlining an expanded raw water intake and supply network, together with an expanded treatment plant at Adamstown and distribution pipelines capable of meeting population demands for the foreseeable future.West Waterford Regional Supply Scheme The West Waterford Area includes almost half of the county. There are over 50 separate Water Supply Schemes currently serving the area, many of which are experiencing supply shortages or water quality problems. The lack of an adequate water supply is a major constraint on the sustainable development of the area. For these reasons, Waterford City & County Council wish to rationalise the existing supply arrangements and develop a new Water Supply for the West Waterford Area.The Councils Assessment of Needs, 2007 - 2016, states:The Department of the Environment have included Ã¢ ‚ ¬2.945m for West Waterford Water Supply Scheme in its 2007 - 2009 Water Services Investment Programme as a Scheme to start in 2008. The Department has already approved the appointment of Consultants to prepare:The Report makes recommendations on necessary emergency and augmentation works.

Waterford City & County Council,departments/water/water-supply.htm,Waterford City & County Council : Water Supply,"Waterford City and County is served by 107 public water supplies. This represents some 10% of the total public schemes in the country. There are 2 major water supplies in the county:Dungarvan water supply is a borehold that serves Dungarvan town and environs.  East Waterford Water Supply is a major water treatment plant that serves East Waterford including the city and Dunmore east region.  In addition, there are 13 reasonably sized schemes that supply between 200-800m3/day (serving ~20% of demand) and that serve the larger towns, for example, Tallow, Lismore, Stradbally, Kilmacthomas.The remainder of the water supplies (92 number serving~20% of demand) serve small towns and villages and supply <200 m3/day. Of these, there are 68 numbers that are extremely small, serve small rural communities and produce <50 m3/day. These 92 schemes are either sourced from springs or bored wells.

In January 2014 responsibility for these water supplies transferred to Irish Water. Waterford City and County Council have a 12 year contract to maintain these facilities.

The function of the Water Services section is to provide an adequate supply of piped water of suitable quality for domestic, commercial, industrial and other uses and to provide a safe and adequate system for the disposal of sewage and other water-borne waste.

The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government developed a National Drinking Water Monitoring Programme in 2004 (see National Drinking Water Monitoring Programme) to ensure that Water Service Authorities (Local Authorities) testing regimes and standards were in line with the European Drinking Water Standards.

Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/, Government of Ireland ," The Government is the group of senior ministers responsible for the executive power of the State. This means that the Government is responsible for giving effect to laws. You can view this list of current Government Ministers.Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the assistance of the civil service, police force and military. The head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is nominated by the Dáil. The Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the Tánaiste) and a cabinet of ministers to take responsibility for the departments of government.The Government decides major questions of policy and carries out a number of different and important functions.After a general election, the Dáil (the Irish parliament) elects the Taoiseach. Normally the Taoiseach is the leader of the largest party in the Dail. If no one party has a majority of TDs (members of the Dáil), a number of parties may come together to form a coalition government.The Taoiseach then nominates a deputy (the Tánaiste) and a cabinet of ministers who take charge of the departments of government.The acting Taoiseach (the Taoiseach of the former Government) may have to ask the President to dissolve the Dáil and call another general election if no Government can be formed.Article 28 of Bunreacht na hÉireann (the Irish Constitution) sets out the composition of Government. The Constitution states that the Government must not be smaller than 7 members or larger than 15 members.The members of the Government must be members of either Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann. There cannot be more than 2 members of Seanad Éireann appointed to the Government. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must be members of Dáil Éireann.The Taoiseach may also appoint Ministers of State who are also known as Junior Ministers. They are not actually members of the Cabinet but they help Government ministers in their parliamentary and departmental work.The Taoiseach also appoints an Attorney General to advise the Government on legal issues. The Attorney General is not a member of the Government but they traditionally attend Cabinet meetings.If, after a general election, no party can get the support of the majority of the members of the Dáil, 2 or more parties may agree to work together as a coalition government.The coalition parties agree on who will be nominated as Taoiseach. Usually, it is the leader of the larger party. In recent years, the leader of the smaller party has been usually nominated as Tánaiste.The ministerial portfolios are then shared between the parties. Usually the larger party is given a greater number of portfolios. The leader of each party decides which elected members of the party to give those portfolios to.The coalition government remains in power for as long as it keeps the support of the majority of the Dáil. If the coalition parties find that they cannot agree and can no longer work together, the Taoiseach may advise the President to dissolve the Dáil.The Taoiseach is the head of the Government. Taoiseach means 'leader ' or 'chief ' in Irish, but the Irish word is always used for referring to the head of Government in Ireland.The Taoiseach acts as a channel of communication between the Government and the President. They advise the President about summoning and dissolving the Dáil. They present Bills (or proposals for legislation) to the President for signature so that they can become Acts with legal effect. The Taoiseach also keeps the President generally informed on domestic and international policy matters.As the leading public figure in the Government, the Taoiseach also acts as a spokesperson for the Government on major policy issues and chairs Cabinet meetings.They take an interest in the affairs of all the Departments of State and make sure that the plans of departments are co-ordinated. They make sure that Cabinet decisions are carried out by the ministers and that the ministers fully understand the implications of different Government policies.The Taoiseach also has a major role to play in our relations with foreign countries. They represent Ireland abroad and regularly meets with the other heads of state of the European Union to help shape European policy. The Taoiseach is Ireland 's representative on the European Council.The Taoiseach and all the ministers are answerable to Dáil Eireann. The Taoiseach is assisted in his or her duties by the Government Chief Whip.The Tánaiste is the deputy Taoiseach.They act in place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach is abroad or ill. If the Taoiseach dies or becomes permanently incapacitated, the Tanaiste would stand in until a new Taoiseach was appointed.The Tánaiste may also hold a ministerial portfolio, which means that they may also be a minister of a Department of State.Like the other members of the Government, the Tánaiste may be dismissed by the Taoiseach if they consider that there is sufficient reason to do so.The Government Chief Whip is the Minister of State for the Department of the Taoiseach. They are responsible for the organisation and co-ordination of Government business in Dáil Éireann.The Chief Whip acts as a channel of communication between the Government and the opposition parties.The Chief Whip is also responsible for making sure that the Government has a voting majority in the Dáil by making sure that TDs attend Dáil sessions when a vote is being taken. To instruct a TD to attend to vote, he or she can issue a whip.If a Government TD votes against the Government, they may lose the whip. This means that they are suspended from the party. The Taoiseach can decide to restore a TD 's whip.The Chief Whip has a function in monitoring the progress made by Government departments in preparing legislation. They also arrange for the proposed legislation to be considered and debated in the Dáil.You can read about:If you have a question about this topic you can contact the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).You can also contact your local Citizens Information Centre."

There are 18 government departments. As well as the Cabinet minister assigned to the department, The Taoiseach may also appoint junior ministers, or Ministers of State to help run departments.Each department employs a large number of civil servants, including a Secretary General, who remain in their positions regardless of changes in the Government. These officials advise and assist the minister in the running of the department.You can find out about government spending in each of these departments on whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie. You can also read about the responsibilities of the people who manage government departments on whodoeswhat.gov.ie.The minister is responsible for their department and the Taoiseach can remove a minister at any time. Ministers are part of the Government and sit at cabinet meetings, where decisions about government policy and proposals for new Government bills are decided.The minister may suggest and propose new or amended legislation to the Government relating to matters that arise in their department.Ministers also have a power to make Statutory Instruments which are also known as delegated or secondary legislation. A Minister may only make a Statutory Instrument if they are permitted to do so in primary legislation.

Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-civil-service/, Civil Service ," The civil service carries out the work of Government and delivers public services. Civil servants are the permanent staff of departments of state, but they may also work for other public bodies.The Constitution of Ireland does not mention the civil service but it is vital to the functioning of the state.The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour (pdf) says that the mission of the civil service is the achievement of an excellent service for the Government and the other institutions of State, as well as for the public as citizens and users of public services.The Public Appointments Service provides recruitment, assessment and selection services for the civil service. They also provide recruitment and consultancy services to local authorities, the Health Service Executive , An Garda SÃ­ochána and other public bodies.The Commission for Public Service Appointments is a separate body. The Commission sets standards, which it publishes as codes of practice, for recruitment and selection to the civil service, An Garda SÃ­ochána and a number of public service bodies, including the Health Service Executive.The civil service has three main functions:Each Department of State has a permanent staff consisting of administrative, professional, specialist and technical employees. The head civil servant of each Department is the Secretary General, who is recommended by the Minister for that Department and appointed for a period of 7 years by the Government.Below the Secretary General, there are a number of Assistant Secretaries, who are each responsible for specific areas of work in the Department. Below the Assistant Secretaries, there are many officials at varying levels of seniority who are graded according to their seniority.The Public Appointments Service provides recruitment, assessment and selection services for the civil service. They also provide recruitment and consultancy services to local authorities, the Health Service Executive , An Garda SÃ­ochána and other public bodies. Civil and public service jobs are advertised on publicjobs.ie.The Commission for Public Service Appointments sets standards, which it publishes as codes of practice, for recruitment and selection to the civil service, An Garda SÃ­ochána and a number of public service bodies, including the Health Service Executive.Civil servants are the branch of the public service that works directly for the Government in government departments or in certain state agencies which carry out functions on behalf of the State, but which are independent of Government. For example, those who fall work in the Central Bank of Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners are civil servants of the State.All civil servants are also public servants. However, the public service covers a much broader range of professions which are paid for by the State. This includes many teachers, doctors, nurses, gardaÃ­ and employees of other agencies that provide state services to the public.Chapter House26-30 Abbey Street UpperDublin 1IrelandIf you have a question about this topic you can contact the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).You can also contact your local Citizens Information Centre."
Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/, Fundamental rights under the Irish Constitution ," The Irish Constitution recognises and declares that people living in Ireland have certain fundamental personal rights.Articles 40 to 44 set out these fundamental rights. Many of the rights apply to everyone living in Ireland, including non-Irish citizens.The rights that are set out in these articles have been interpreted by the courts, and some articles have been amended since the Constitution was written in 1937. The courts have found that some rights are protected by the Constitution, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.Fundamental rights are not absolute - they can be limited or restricted by the Oireachtas for certain reasons (for the common good or to keep public order for example).If there is a conflict between two or more constitutional rights in a case, the courts will look at all the circumstances and weigh all of the factors to decide how that particular conflict is to be dealt with. For instance, there is often a clash between one person 's right to freedom of expression and another person 's right to their good name.Article 40 sets out 'personal rights ', including:All citizens shall be held equal before the law (Article 40.1 of the Constitution). This means that the State cannot unjustly, unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminate between citizens. You cannot be treated as inferior or superior to any other person in society simply because of your human attributes or your ethnic, racial, social or religious background.However, when the State is making laws, it may consider differences of capacity and of social function between individuals in society.The Constitution specifically recognises and protects your right to life (Article 40.4).Your right to life also means the right to have nature take its course and to die a natural death. That does not mean that you have the right to have your life terminated or death unnaturally accelerated.In May 2018, the people voted in a referendum to allow the Oireachtas to pass laws regulating the termination of pregnancy. The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was signed into law on 20 December 2018.The Constitution guarantees that you have a right to liberty and freedom, except in accordance with the law (Article 40.4).This means that, in general, you are entitled to your own personal freedom except where regulated by law. In addition, the law may provide for your detention in certain circumstances and the State may only breach your right to personal liberty in circumstances that come within that law.If you believe that you are being detained or held unlawfully, you can make an application to the High Court. If the person or institution detaining you cannot justify your detention or prove that it is lawful, the High Court may order that you be released. This is called a habeas corpus order.You have a right to move freely within the State. You also have a broader right to travel and to get a passport for the purpose of travelling.Your right to a passport may be restricted or limited. For example, before granting you bail, a court may require you to hand over your passport. The State may also restrict your right to travel abroad for the purposes of national security.You have a right to freely express your convictions and opinions (Article 40.6.1.i). However, that right can be limited in the interests of public order and morality. You can also not use this right to defame someone else as this would interfere their constitutional right to a good name.The Constitution also states that it is an offence to publish or utter seditious (material undermining the authority of the State or advocating for the overthrow of the State) or indecent material.Following a referendum in May 2018, the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Act 2018 was passed. Blasphemy is no longer a constitutional offence.The State is also obliged by the Constitution to make sure that media such as the radio, the press and the cinema are not used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. For example, the Censorship of Publications Acts and the Censorship of Films Acts allow censorship of publications like books, films and DVDs.You have a right to assemble or meet peacefully and without weapons (Article 40.6.1.ii). This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. The law prevents or controls meetings that are calculated or designed to cause a riot or breach of the peace or which may be a danger to the general public.There are other limitations on your freedom of assembly. You cannot meet on private property without the consent of the owner - that is trespass. Parades and processions are not illegal but it is a public nuisance to obstruct a highway without authorisation.You may not hold a procession or meeting within half a mile of the Houses of the Oireachtas when a chief superintendent or higher ranking garda informs the organisers of such an event that it is prohibited or where any garda within that half-mile radius asks you to disperse.The Constitution guarantees your right to form associations and unions (Article 40.6.1.iii). You may form any type of association for whatever purpose you choose, whether it is sporting, social, charitable, commercial or political.This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. For example, associations formed for the purpose of treason or some anti-constitutional or illegal purpose cannot rely on this right to freedom of association.Similarly, you can 't force someone to join any particular association or union or always force a union or association to accept you.The courts and all public bodies or persons making decisions that affect your constitutional rights must treat you fairly. Two of the essential components of fair procedures in this context are:You have a right not to have your body or person unjustifiably interfered with. A person can only interfere with your body with a valid justification and in a proportionate manner. Similarly, you have a right not to be subjected to torture, inhumane or degrading treatment.If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison.Your constitutional right to trial by jury only exists in certain criminal cases.If you have been charged with a ""non-minor"" offence, you will be tried by a judge sitting with a jury. There are some offences for which you will be given a choice - whether you want to have your case decided by a District Court judge sitting alone or by a judge sitting with a jury.The jury must consist of those who have been chosen at random from a diverse range of jurors from the community.The Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy but the courts recognise that the personal rights in the Constitution imply the right to privacy. It has sometimes been described as the right ""to be let alone"" in private settings.For example, your private written communications and telephone conversations cannot be deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably interfered with. Your rights to cast a secret ballot in elections and to the confidentiality of medical details are other examples of the right to privacy in action.However, your right to privacy may be limited or restricted by legislation in the interests of the common good, public order and morality.As a citizen, you have a right to work and to earn a living, whether you are male or female. However, that general right doesn 't mean that you can insist on being employed in a particular role or area or by a particular employer.The State has a general duty to protect your right to work and earn a livelihood from unjust attack.The Constitution declares that the dwelling of a citizen is inviolable and shall not be entered forcibly except in accordance with the law (Article 40.5). This means that no one, including the GardaÃ­, may enter the place where you live without a warrant or other legal authority to enter.If you are arrested as a result of an unlawful entry into your home, your arrest is illegal. Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful entry onto your dwelling may be inadmissible in court.The family founded on marriage possesses a collection of constitutional rights (Article 41 and 42). These include:Many of these rights equally apply to non-marital families.There is a constitutional principle that married parents have equal rights to and are joint guardians of their children. If the parents separate or divorce, the courts may decide who will have custody of the children. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the children.Article 42A was added to the Constitution in 2015. It affirms children 's natural and imprescriptible rights and the State 's duty to uphold these rights. Children have the right for their best interests to be of paramount consideration where the State seeks to intervene to protect their safety and welfare.This right applies in all court proceedings concerning adoption, guardianship, custody, and access. In these proceedings, children also have the right to have their views ascertained and considered by the courts. The courts are to have regard to a child 's age and maturity when considering their views in accordance with this right.Two constitutional referendums will be held on 8 March 2024 to amend the Constitution.You can find information about the proposed changes to the Constitution.The General Scheme of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2023 has been published, which is draft legislation for these proposed amendments.The Constitution declares that the State will vindicate the property rights of every citizen. This means that you have a right to own, transfer and inherit property. You also have the right to bequeath property upon your death.

It is the fundamental law of the State.Every part of the Constitution is set out in both the Irish and English languages. Article 8 states that the Irish language is the first official language and that the English language is recognised as a second official language.The Constitution establishes the branches or organs of government, it establishes the courts and sets out how those institutions should be run. It also describes the fundamental rights of every Irish citizen.The Constitution is also part of a wider human rights framework in Ireland. This refers to all legal and other human rights commitments made by Ireland, including treaties under the United Nations, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.The Constitution contains 50 articles.Articles 1-39 define the functions of the State and its agencies and set out the separation of powers in the State.Articles 40-44 provide for the fundamental rights of Irish citizens.The remaining articles are:Article 45, which sets out directive principles of social policyArticle 46, which sets out how the Constitution may be amendedArticle 47, which governs referendumsArticles 48-50, which repealed the previous Constitution (of Saorstát Éireann) and ensured the continuance of lawsOne of the most important Articles of the Constitution is Article 15.4, which states that the Oireachtas must not enact any law that is repugnant to the Constitution (conflicts with the Constitution). This means that the Constitution is superior to all other law.If any element of an existing law is found to be repugnant to the Constitution, that element of the law is invalid (Article 15.4.2).If a proposed new law would be repugnant to the Constitution, it cannot be enacted unless the Constitution has been amended accordingly ""“ see 'Amending the Constitution' below.Article 25 provides that Bills passed by both houses of the Oireachtas should be presented to the President for signature. Once a Bill has been signed by the President, it becomes law. However, Article 26 provides that the President may refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to decide if it is repugnant to the Constitution. The President will not sign the Bill into law if the Supreme Court decides against it.Every law that is enacted is presumed to be constitutional until it is proven not to be. The High Court has the power or jurisdiction to cancel any law or part of any law that is repugnant to the Constitution.The consent of the Irish people is needed before the Constitution can be amended. This means that amendments to the Constitution can only be made by way of a constitutional referendum. Up to 2023, 38 constitutional referendums had been held, of which 32 resulted in amendments to the Constitution. A list of the amending Acts is at the front of the Constitution published on irishstatutebook.ie.If no petition challenging the result is presented to the High Court within 7 days of its publication, the certificate becomes final. The President will then sign the Bill to change the Constitution and the Constitution will be amended.

Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/main-institutions-of-the-state/, Main institutions of the Irish State ," Ireland is a constitutional republic, which means that the fundamental rules that determine how the State behaves, how laws are made, and how power should be used are set out in a written constitution.It also means that the people of Ireland elect who they want to represent them, govern them, and make laws on their behalf.The Irish Constitution establishes and describes the main institutions of the State. The power to run the State is divided into 3 separate branches:The Constitution tries to keep these powers separate to guarantee that there is not too much power in the hands of one institution of the State.The Irish Constitution says that all of the power of the State comes from the Irish people. It also says that that the power to govern is divided between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.The Legislature has law-making power. Only the Oireachtas (the national parliament), with the President as its head, can make laws in Ireland. See 'The Legislature' below.The Executive has the power to enforce the law, run the departments of the State and set the agenda of the Oireachtas. The Government, led by the Taoiseach, has the executive power of the State. See 'The Executive ' below.The Judiciary has the power to interpret the law. The Irish courts system has this power, which includes the power to decide if a piece of legislation or law is unconstitutional. See 'The Judiciary ' below.The Constitution sets out how these state powers should work, and puts in place checks and balances to prevent institutions from having too much power.The legislative power is the power to make laws. The Oireachtas does this through introducing and changing legislation. Articles 15 to 27 of the Constitution give this power to the national parliament or the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas comprises:The main function of the Oireachtas is to make new laws and amend existing laws. New laws start as Bills, and must be debated by the Dáil and Seanad and passed by both Houses before the President can sign the bill into law. If the Seanad does not pass a bill, the Dáil can still enter the bill into law, but must pass a resolution declaring that the Bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses. When a bill becomes law, it is known as an Act of the Oireachtas.Any sitting TD (Teachta Dála, the name given to elected members of the Dáil) or Senator can publish a Bill and try to have it passed by the House, but the Bill must have the Government 's support if it involves spending public money.The President has the power to refer a bill to the Supreme Court to seek a judgment that the law is constitutional.TDs are elected in general elections, which must be held at least every 5 years. Senators are either appointed by the Taoiseach, or elected in Seanad elections, which take place after a general election has been held.The Oireachtas also elects the Government and passes budgets for Government Departments.Article 28 of the Constitution gives executive power to the Government.Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the assistance of the civil service, police force and military. The head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is nominated by the Dáil. The Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the Tánaiste) and a cabinet of ministers to take responsibility for the Departments of Government.The Government is usually formed by the largest party in the Dáil after a general election. A Government formed from two or more parties is called a coalition government.The Government must have at least 7 members (which must include the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance), and at most 15 members. A maximum of 2 senators can be appointed as Ministers.The Government is answerable to Dáil Éireann, and will not survive without the support of the majority of TDs.The judicial power is the power to interpret and apply the law to disputes and conflicts that arise between the State and the individual and disputes and conflicts that arise between individuals. Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution give this power to the courts.Under Article 35, judges of the courts are independent of the Government and can only be removed through a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas for misbehaviour or incapacity.Judges are appointed by the President, who acts on the advice of the Government. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board advises the Government on suitable candidates for the bench.You can read more about:Leinster HouseKildare StreetDublin 2Ireland15-24 Phoenix Street NorthSmithfieldDublin 7IrelandGovernment BuildingsUpper Merrion StreetDublin 2IrelandIf you have a question about this topic you can contact the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).You can also contact your local Citizens Information Centre."

It should offer assistance to enable you to make a request, particularly if you have literacy difficulties or a disability.If the request is complex or a large volume of information is required, the authority must write to you within a month and inform you of its difficulties processing your request. It must also give you a date by which it will respond, which must be not more than 2 months after it got your original request.The AIE Regulations require public authorities to designate information officers to maintain registers or lists of the environmental information held, or else provide an information point to indicate clearly where such information can be found. Public authorities must also register and process all requests for the environmental information that they hold.If the authority to which you make your request does not have the information, it may transfer your request to the authority that does have it, and inform you of this. However, instead of transferring your request, it may provide you with information about where to send your request. You may be refused access to some types of information. For example, you may be refused information about the location of an endangered species if disclosure of this information could put the species at risk. You may also be refused access to draft or incomplete documents, internal communication (such as internal emails) or material that is commercially sensitive. Further details on exemptions are available in the guidance notes (pdf). In general, you cannot be refused information about emissions into the environment. A request for information using the AIE Regulations can be refused if the information is required to be made available under any other statutory provision - for example, where a planning authority is required to publish the information or make a planning file available.The public authority must notify you of the refusal of your request generally within 1 month. If you do not get a response within this time you can assume that your request has been refused.There are reasons when you can be legally refused access to environmental information. However, if a public authority refuses your request for information or has not dealt with your request appropriately, you can seek an internal review of the decision made by the public authority. If you require an internal review, you must request it within 1 month of getting the decision.If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review you can appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental Information (CEI). You must appeal within 1 month of getting the reviewed decision from the public authority. The CEI may extend the time limit if he/she believes it is reasonable to do so. Public authorities must comply with the CEI's decisions and if necessary the CEI can apply to the High Court to have a decision upheld. The CEI's decisions are published on ocei.gov.ie.You (or any other person affected by the CEI 's decision) can appeal to the High Court on a point of law arising from that decision. The CEI publishes further information on how to appeal.See 'How to apply' below for more details on requesting an internal review or making an appeal. There is no charge for applying for environmental information under the AIE Regulations. You may get the information without charge, but there may be a fee to take account of the costs of compiling and copying information. Public authorities must make publicly available a list of fees, if any, charged for providing environmental information. There is no charge for an internal review of a decision by a public authority. However, if the review decides that you should get the information you requested, you may be charged for photocopying etc.It costs â‚¬50 to take an appeal to the CEI, or â‚¬15 if you have a medical card. If you were not a party to the original request and are appealing a decision to release information that you feel will incriminate you, the fee is â‚¬15. You must make your request for environmental information in writing or electronic form. Refer to the public authority 's website or Information Unit for guidance. When sending your request, you must:If you require the information in a specific format (such as email or letter) you should specify which format in your request. You do not have to state your interest in making the request.Your application for environmental information should be sent to the public authority that holds the information you require.

Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/facilities-for-voters-with-disabilities/, Facilities for voters with disabilities ," There are arrangements in place for people with disabilities, illnesses, visual impairments, or reading and writing disabilities, to allow you to exercise your right to vote. You can:Whenever possible, polling stations are located in buildings that are accessible to people with disabilities. Polling stations must always be at the ground floor level. Temporary ramps can be installed to facilitate access.Voting compartments in polling stations are usually designed for people who are standing up. The returning officer (the person responsible for organising the election or referendum in your constituency) must make a table and chair available for voters who need to sit down.The returning officer will give public notice of all the polling stations in the constituency that are not accessible to wheelchair users. If you have difficulty gaining access to your local polling station, you can apply in writing to the returning officer at least a week before polling day for permission to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. In Dublin and Cork, the returning officer is the city or county sheriff. In other counties, it is the county registrar.To help the returning officer pick a suitable alternative station you should explain in your application why you cannot access your local station. If possible, you should suggest another polling station that is both accessible and convenient for you. The returning officer will send you written authorisation to vote at another polling station, usually the one that you have suggested. You should present this authorisation (along with the usual evidence of identity) when you go to vote. Once you have been assigned another polling station, you cannot vote at your local station.The presiding officer is the person who is responsible for taking the poll at a polling station. A supervising presiding officer may also be on duty ""“ their responsibilities include supervising the arrangements for voters with disabilities. You can ask to see the supervising presiding officer if you need assistance.There are strict rules to ensure that the secrecy and security of the ballot are maintained. The law is specific about the types of voters who can be helped to vote, how they may be helped, and who may help them. The presiding officer has to apply the law, which is intended to make sure that you can vote the way you want to and that your vote is kept secret.Depending on the nature of your disability, you may be helped to vote in 3 ways:If you have a visual impairment, a disability or a literacy difficulty that prevents you from voting without assistance, you can bring a companion with you to mark the ballot paper for you. This person must be at least 16 years old and cannot:If the presiding officer does not believe that the person you choose is eligible to act as a companion, another person can act as your companion or you can ask the presiding officer to assist you.When a companion is assisting you, they go into a voting compartment with you and you tell them how to mark the ballot. The companion then places the marked ballot paper in the ballot box.If you have a visual impairment, a disability or a literacy difficulty that prevents you from voting without assistance, the presiding officer can help you mark the ballot paper.The presiding officer and the personation agents go with you to a part of the polling station where a conversation at a normal volume cannot be overheard. A personation agent is a representative of a candidate who supervises the polling and helps prevent electoral offences.If necessary, the presiding officer will suspend entry to the polling station and have it cleared, to ensure that nobody can hear how you vote. The personation agents are there as witnesses to make sure that the presiding officer follows your instructions. As with everyone involved in a poll, there is a statutory obligation on personation agents to keep your vote secret.The presiding officer asks how you want to vote and marks the ballot paper according to your preferences. They will read out any information from the ballot paper you may need to hear to make your decision. They then put the ballot paper in the ballot box.The law forbids a presiding officer from acting on any written instructions received from a voter. This is because someone else may have written or changed the instructions and it would make it harder to be sure that your vote was being cast the way you want.If you want the presiding officer to help you vote, you should go to the polling station well before it closes at night. The law allows a presiding officer to refuse a request for assistance during the last two hours of voting if helping one elector would prevent others from voting. This restriction does not apply to companion voting - you can be helped to vote by a companion at any time during polling hours.A ballot paper template is a transparent plastic device that is placed on top of a ballot paper. The template has raised print and braille on it, so that visually impaired people can vote without assistance. You can use this option if you have a visual impairment and don't want to be helped by a companion or presiding officer to mark your ballot paper.The template is used with a Freephone number that identifies the candidates in your area. If you want to listen to this information before polling day, you can get the number from your local authority or returning officer. You can listen to the information before polling day to familiarise yourself with it and/or you can use your mobile phone to call the number while you are in the polling compartment.Ballot paper templates are available at each polling station. If you tell the presiding officer that you want to use a template, you will be handed a ballot paper with the template attached to it.Raised print and Braille are used to identify the openings in the template that match the squares on the ballot paper. You mark your choices on the ballot paper beneath the template. There is a flap over each opening, so that you can close the flap when you have marked a square. When you have finished marking the ballot paper, you can detach it from the template, fold it and place it in the ballot box in the usual way.The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has information about using the template. There is more detail about the templates on ncbi.ie.If you live at home and you have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to a polling station, you may qualify to vote by post. You must apply to your local authority to be included in the Postal Voters List.If you are living in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution and you have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to the polling station, you can vote at the hospital or nursing home.

You then put this envelope and the completed receipt for the ballot paper into the large envelope addressed to the returning officer, seal it and post it. The ballot paper must be posted - it cannot be given directly to the returning officer.Shortly before polling day, you will be notified of the day and approximate time when a special presiding officer will call to you at the hospital or nursing home to allow you to vote. This official will show you evidence of their identity and an appointment warrant when they arrive. They will be accompanied by a Garda, whose role is to guard the ballot papers (in the same way as in a polling station) and to act as an independent witness to guarantee that the voting procedure is carried out properly.Only the presiding officer and the Garda can be present when you cast your vote. The presiding officer will give you a declaration of identity, which they will witness for you. You then mark the ballot paper in secret, place it in the special envelope provided, close the envelope and present it to the presiding officer.If you need help with voting, the special presiding officer will provide it in the same way as at a polling station.You can find more information for voters with disabilities on gov.ie.

Citizens Information,/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/proportional-representation/, Proportional representation ," When you vote in an election in Ireland, you are asked to give your vote in order of preference. This is because Ireland uses an electoral system called proportional representation with a single transferrable vote (PR""“STV, or PR for short).The names of candidates appear in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, along with their photographs and their party emblem (if they wish).You vote by writing ""1"" or ""one"" opposite your first choice candidate, ""2"" or ""two"" opposite your second choice, ""3"" or ""three"" opposite your third choice, and so on. You can stop after indicating your first choice candidate or you can continue to give a preferential vote to as many candidates on the ballot paper as you wish.When you vote with more than one preference, you are instructing the returning officer (the person responsible for the counting of votes) that if your preferred candidate is eliminated, or elected with a surplus of votes, you want your vote to be transferred to your second choice candidate.PR is used in all elections in Ireland, including:At the polling station on election day, you will be given a stamped ballot paper. The returning officer may ask to see some identification or a polling card. You cast your vote in a private space. The election candidates will be listed alphabetically alongside their picture, the name of their party (if they belong to a political party) and their party emblem (in some cases). You vote by placing the number of your choice next to the candidate or candidates that you have chosen.You can vote for as many or as few of the candidates as you wish.If you want to vote for one candidate only, you should mark the number ""1"" or the word ""one"" in the box next to the candidate 's name. You should not tick or mark the box with an X.Pencils will be provided, but you can bring your own pen or pencil if you wish.When you have voted you should fold your ballot paper so your vote is not visible and put the folded ballot paper into the ballot box.If you make a mistake on your ballot paper, the returning officer may give you another ballot paper. This is at the discretion of the returning officer. If you have already posted your ballot in the ballot box, the returning officer cannot give you another ballot paper.Ballot papers that cannot be counted are called spoiled votes. A ballot papers may be spoiled if:When polling is over, all the ballot boxes are taken to a central counting place for each constituency. The count starts at 9am on the day after polling day. Each ballot box is opened separately and the ballot papers in each box are counted. The total number is compared with the total number of ballot papers issued for that box - this is done to check that ballot papers have not been put into or taken out of the box since the poll closed.The ballot papers are then sorted into piles of ballot papers for each candidate.The ballot papers are counted and sorted, and spoiled papers are rejected.The total valid poll is the total number of votes minus the number of spoiled papers.The count then takes place over a number of rounds. As candidates are elected or eliminated, the second, third (or lower) preference votes on that candidate 's ballot paper are counted.Counting continues until all the seats have been filled.To be elected, a candidate must generally reach the quota for the constituency. The last seat can be filled by a candidate who did not reach the quota if all the other candidates have been elected or eliminated.The quota is calculated by dividing the total valid poll by 1 more than the number of available seats (if there is a number to carry over, it is ignored), and then adding 1.For example, in a 4-seat constituency with a total valid poll of 25,000, the quota is:25,000 (the total valid poll) divided by 5 (1 more than the number of seats), which is 5,000. Then add 1. The quota is 5,001.If a candidate receives more than the quota, their surplus ballot papers are transferred to the remaining candidates.The surplus is transferred in proportion to how many second (or lower) preferences the other candidates received in the elected candidate 's vote. If the second preference candidate on any ballot is either already elected or has been eliminated, then the third preference is used, and so on.If a candidate is elected at the first count, then all their votes are used to calculate the proportion of surplus that will be given to each candidate.For example:Candidate A receives 6,000 first preference votes at the first count. The quota is 5,000. A is elected with a surplus of 1,000 votes.Out of A 's 6,000 total votes, 30% gave their second preference to B, and 20% gave their second preference to C.B receives 300 votes (30% of 1,000) and C receives 200 votes (20% of 1,000)Where a candidate reaches the quota after the first count, only the ballot papers that brought them over the quota are examined (the votes that were transferred from the previous count).If 2 or more candidates are elected at the same time, then the surplus of the candidate with the largest vote is distributed first.If nobody reaches the quota after a round of counting, then the candidate with the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and all their votes are distributed. More than one candidate can be eliminated after a round of voting if it is clear that they cannot be elected, and they cannot qualify to have their election expenses repaid.Candidates can qualify for recoupment (repayment) of their election expenses (up to a maximum of â‚¬8,700 at a Dáil election), if they:There are extra count rules to give candidates every chance of reaching this vote threshold. At a bye-election, the threshold is calculated differently to ensure that the minimum number of votes needed to qualify for recoupment of election expenses at a general election and at a bye-election in the same constituency is broadly comparable.A recount can be ordered if a candidate asks for one, or if the returning officer decides that a recount is needed.A candidate might ask for a recount of a particular count, or round of voting. This means that the votes that were counted in the last round only are counted again and corrected if necessary.A candidate might ask for a total recount, which means that all the votes are counted as they are at the time of the request. If an error is found, then all the votes are recounted from the time the mistake happened.It is possible that candidates that have already been deemed to be elected, could have their election overturned because of a recount. A candidate is deemed to be elected once they reach the quota of votes.However, once the result is declared, a recount can only happen if it is ordered by the High Court. A candidate is declared elected when the total count is complete and the returning officer has declared the results.The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have published a guide to proportional representation (pdf).Custom HouseDublin 1D01 W6X0IrelandIf you have a question about this topic you can contact the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).You can also contact your local Citizens Information Centre."
